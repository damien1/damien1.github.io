      <description>So London Startup Weekend will happen … it has taken a lot longer to get the next weekend event going then we all thought. To be honest, Startup Weekend takes time and patience – patiently working with venue sponsors, helping them to gain internal approval and working through security issues.
Patience takes time .. so the next Startup Weekend will be happening soon. We’ve now got a team of about 6 people to work on London Startup Weekend and hopefully soon we’ll have a venue to really consider.</description>
