      <description>I’m the type who is always overwhelmed by TV advertising– as I don’t watch ‘live’ TV or commercial TV with ads I often find myself watching adverts on the internet for the sake of it! I even occasionally, download these adverts to save them and watch them again and again and again and …Can I just say I’m against flashmobs, my new found British sensibility (*read – I’ve just handed in my UK citizenship application) does not condone such public displays – it’s embarrassing and I was overexposed to the last T-mobile flashmob thanks to my gyms in-house digital signage.</description>

      <description>Comment: Internet traffic to the iPlayer site is growing rapidly supported by outside advertising posterboards as well as reminders during TV advertising. However a lot of internet traffic seems to be sucked up by their kservices P2P network which aims to share the downloaded files with other iPlayer users.
 UK Internet traffic to the BBC’s iPlayer website increased 14-fold between the week ending 8 December 2007 and the week ending 5 January.</description>
