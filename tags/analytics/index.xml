      <description>You may not have noticed, but I have … I’ve been quiet, and not been adding any new posts or updates to any of my WordPress plugin. I’ve also been busy and there are never enough hours in the day. I want to set out some thoughts on how a content strategy might help or detract.
Google Analytics One interesting Google Analytics trend that pops up when I look at my stats over a long period (try 3 years) is that these busy peaks (at work) also correlate with the downward slumps in visitor numbers.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been running WordPress as a multisite network and I often get asked about what are the best plugins for WordPress. Everyone has their opinion. I&amp;rsquo;ve listed the plugins which are network activated and grouped them in some meaningful manner for web marketers and development people.

      <description>Are you responsible for Twitter and Social Media in your business? Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling a bit lost after CoTweet closed its free version (shame on them) … here are a few alternatives you can look at
HootSuite
 yes I said alternative to CoTweet - personally, I like to use my own bit.ly Pro URL so this was not an option. Hootsuitehas a very reasonably priced premium version and it has clients for pretty much any device  MarketMeSuite</description>

      <description>Have you tried Piwik yet? If you&amp;rsquo;ve been using Google Analytics and started to wonder what alternative web analytic tools are out there then look no further then Piwik.
Piwikis a web analytics solution that is free and runs on your own server. It provides a lot of similar features to Google Analytics and will run alongside Google Analytics anyway.
Why stick with Google Analytics? Now I love GA and will always implement it as a first choice.</description>

      <description>So its mid-November and I&amp;rsquo;m just looking at the Google Analytics report to see how I&amp;rsquo;m getting on. Data visualisation is a big thing but raw numbers are also pretty good.20,000 visitors so far this year generated 50,000 page views.
That&amp;rsquo;s pretty good for a one man marketing guy and his machine.
Alexa&amp;rsquo;s Web Information also seems interesting - and if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what Alexa says about your site .</description>
