      <description>What could we do to make this site more useful? That’s a good question … and thanks to Kiss Insights its really easy to ask this of your website visitors.
It’s only one answer &amp;amp; takes one second Web surveys should not be a bore and they should not be too long. We’re all so busy now and being asked to spend 15 mins on a survey is pointless.
I guess that’s what makes the KISS approach so powerful – keep it short and simple.</description>

      <description>ZOHO CRM has some great features including web to lead forms – but they don’t really look too stylish. Especially if you use 3rd party tools for your web forms.
If you use custom web to lead forms you may have to make the change to using the more secure HTTPS connection. After I noticed the web to lead form was not working I checked the standard code from ZOHO.</description>
