      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made a small change to Isotope Visual Layouts Pro and this directly improves caching and website performance.
Isotope Visual Layouts Pro will shortly get a version bump and include a Transient to store the WordPress database query for 1 hour. The transient cache is also cleared when a new post is published.</description>

      <description>Isotope Visual Layouts Pro is getting an update … and it’s one that a few of you have been asking for.
Isotope Visual Layouts Pro 1.9 is currently in testing and it will include a shortcode for Infinite Scroll.
I’m also making it safe to use on any page or post so you can really have different layouts (like one with infinite scroll and one with filtrify)
This will be the ‘last’ update for Isotope Visual Layouts Pro … I’m working on something hotter with sorting and drag n drop.</description>

      <description>Enabling and Disabling Jetpack for WordPress individual plugins presented a bit of a challenge recently. Not having used Jetpack before, I thought it time to try out this collection of plugins developed and maintained by Automattic over the past 4 weeks.
I’ve discovered that Jetpack is a feature rich collection of plugins but I seriously doubled-up on plugins doing the same job. I didn’t need Google Analytics as well as WordPress Stats.</description>

      <description>I’ve just finished work on the first release of my WordPress plugin Visual Layouts Pro — this features the awesome Freetile jQuery plugin for a responsive visual grid layout.
Visual Layouts Pro, like my other plugins, offers the best features for creating a grid layout framework for your WordPress site – without needing to change your theme!
Key Features Visual Layouts WordPress plugin  Uses Twitter Bootstrap CSS and grid framework Shortcode for including the excerpt Pagination Works on any post, page or custom post type Options to include featured images – image and text, or text only.</description>

      <description>Isotope Visual Layouts Pro plugin introduces a click to enlarge feature for box items that are part of the grid layout. This uses a cool jQuery element that changes the CSS class and refreshes the layout of the page.
It took me a bit to learn how to do this – only cause I’m not a frontend developer. But if you’d like to add toggleClass to your Isotope WordPress project, then you might like this.</description>

      <title>Visual Layouts for WordPress turns Pro and gets Twitter Bootstrap</title>

      <description>Visual Layouts is the alternative, responsive, animated, grid layout WordPress plugin. It’s similar to adding isotope and masonry jQuery. Visual Layouts for WordPress is another way that you can change your website without changing your theme.
Now Visual Layouts is turning Pro and the first feature I’ll show off is integration with Twitter Bootstrap CSS.
I think that Twitter Bootstrapis an awesome solution for anyone wanting to use good web design concepts – of course, the internet might be pretty ‘bland’ if we all used this framework.</description>

      <description>“WP to Buffer is a plugin for WordPress that sends updates to your Buffer (bufferapp.com) account for scheduled publishing to social networks when you publish and/or update WordPress Pages, Posts and/or Custom Post Types.”
— Now I like Buffer a lot … I use it mostly via Twitter to ‘Buffer’ my tweets at different times of the day.
If you don’t already have a plugin to send your scheduled posts to Twitter then here’s a plugin to try that will send them to your Buffer queue.</description>

It can be applied to a container element and it will attempt to arrange it’s children in a layout that makes optimal use of screen space, by “packing” them in a tight arrangement.</description>
