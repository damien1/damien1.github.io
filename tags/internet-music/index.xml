      <description>Comment: Pandora has been around for some time and grown in reputation as a free music discovery service. This is becoming a niche space because of the impact of internet radio or streaming licencing costs.
 In an email to users, Pandora founder Tim Westergren wrote:
â€œAfter over a year of trying, this has proved impossible. Both the PPL (which represents the record labels) and the MCPS/PRS Alliance (which represents music publishers) have demanded per track performance minima rates which are far too high to allow ad supported radio to operate and so, hugely disappointing and depressing to us as it is, we have to block the last territory outside of the US.</description>
