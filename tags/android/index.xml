      <description>Is Revolutionary the easiest tool? (answer – no) If you’ve been keeping up with the world of custom rom’s to root your Android you may have heard about this. Revolutionary doesn’t get much of a mention as it’s still an Alpha release, but it does bring together to great development teams.
Revolutionary is only for Linux or Windows users and really supports the newer range of Android devices like the HTC Sensation</description>

      <description>I’ve been writing about Android for some time now. Here are 4 of the best Android apps for Wifi. These apps allow you to find public wi-fi networks, turn your phone into a wifi hotspot and a bit more.
HTC Wifi Hotspot This app can’t be downloaded from the market – its part of HTC build for Android 2.2 Froyo
I’ve used this loads of times – its great for getting my laptop or iPad on the Internet when needed, but the main point to remember is it kills your battery very fast.</description>

      <description>Google recently announced some exciting new features for Android 3.0 Honeycomb. Most notably, Android 3.0 sees tablets and mobile devices merge to the same code base. This is kind of like having one OS for all devices. There are interface design considerations that need to be understood before launching your app on the big screen.

      <description>Are you suffering from Android Market download issues? Have you just rooted your Android with Cyanogenmod and found you can’t download Google Maps?
If you can’t download Google Maps it’s because most Android phones have a download cache limited to 3MB and Google Maps is a whooping 5.4MB.
How to Download large files after rooting your Android The answer to your problems is S2E simple2ext – which moves your download cache off the phone to your SD Card.</description>

At the basic level – Network Info II reports details on your mobile network connection, IP address, Wi-Fi connection, Bluetooth and details about your device and your sim card.</description>

      <description>Is z4root the easiest tool? If you’ve been keeping up with the world of custom rom’s to root your Android you may have heard about this.
z4root doesn’t get much of a mention – its key differentiator is that it is an untethered root tool – eg you run it from your mobile and not from your PC or Mac.
I’ve got a Samsung Galaxy Europa prepay on Vodafone UK – I needed to do screenshots and the only good way to do this involves running root first.</description>

I don’t have many widgets as they eat up battery life (and annoyingly want internet connection).

      <description>I’ve just discovered the (not official) Last.fm live wallpaper for Android. It’s a brilliant change to my boring background on my HTC Desire.
Last.fm is still there tracking my music listening habits – and doing a good job of that. This live wallpaper has a number of options and the free version allows you to create a wallpaper of your favourite artists for example.
The idea for this (app) is also brilliant – it needs no real user interface – and for a small price you get a premium wallpaper with options for weekly charts.</description>

      <description>Android users tend to download fewer apps – and this is because there is no computer application to easily browse and download apps in the same way that iTunes works for iOS devices. A few weeks back the revamped Android Market website was launched. But it still struggles to tie the phone to the computer.

      <description>Develop apps for Android or develop mobile apps for Apple, some days its hard to figure out just what to do. On this website I’ve written a lot on Android phones and apps.Around 6000 apps have been removed from the Apple store recently due to their erotic nature. It’s not that Android Market has no quality control – Adult or Erotic does not exist as a content category in Android Market but dating apps or other soft-porn apps so far have not shown huge growth (ahem) on Android.</description>

      <description>DROID sales in the USA and the robo-promotional ads from Verizon has boosted Android sales, so much so that hits on my blog have started to double since the new phone went on sale.

      <description>Sony Ericsson delivered a blow to Microsoft on Tuesday when it unveiled its latest Xperia handset, which unlike its Windows-powered predecessors is based on Google’s Android operating system.
Called X10, the flagship smartphone comes with a new Sony Ericsson-designed user interface that aggregates the user’s contacts and communications from the likes of Facebook and Twitter into a single address book.
The system is akin to HTC’s Sense interface, and Motorola’s Motoblur interface, both of which feature on the respective companies’ new Android phones.</description>

      <description>Recently the blogosphere has gone a bit crazy, excuse my lack of hyperbole about the Android platform. Was this ‘Android’ supposed to do battle with the iPhone?
Just because no operators or manufacturers have openly commented about their smart phone sales figures doesn’t mean its bad news. Looking at the number of Android powered phones out now or due in the next 2 months shows a lot of promise
 HTC Hero – some bloggers say it’s the best Android yet G1 – the funny one with the flip out keyboard, still only with T-Mobile Magic – Vodafone took this and the Android platform global Tattoo – coming out again to Vodafone before xmas Motorola DEXT – a lifesaver for Motorola – probably the phone that saves them.</description>

      <description>So its Happy Birthday to Apple and its App Store – 1 year old. Its created a new industry and probably will change the way everyone digests content – now that everything has an app or a widget you dont need to browse for it.
Except for Search – Apple and the Apps store has changed how mobile phone manufacturers think about content like Nokia, RIM and Sony Ericsson all launched (or launching) app stores in the past 3 months.</description>
