      <description>It is easy to stop most WordPress comment spam instantly with one small change to your theme’s functions.php. This is one of my favourite WordPress functions and I use it on all my setups.
This code snippet works by blocking comments from being added offsite or indirectly and not from the comment box on your webpage. Most spammers try to automate their ‘workload’ and try to exploit WordPress functions that allow you to manage comments or add posts via the WordPress API’s.</description>

      <description>Do you have problems with read / write permissions with WordPress? Are you stuck and can’t upload or change files? If you’ve tried to change the CHMOD values and failed, it might be time to go to the command-line.
Working Alone – Single WordPress site Run these commands from terminal (command line interface) or ask your web host provider to do this. This will set all files to read/write for the owner and read only for everything else.</description>

      <description>The title field and the big Post Editing Area are fixed in place, but you can reposition all the other boxes using drag and drop, and can minimize or expand them by clicking the title bar of each box.
Use the Screen Options tab to unhide more boxes (Excerpt, Send Trackbacks, Custom Fields, Discussion, Slug, Author) or to choose a 1- or 2-column layout for this screen.</description>

      <description>No – font’s are not locked in WordPress, but it’s easy to switch to the HTML Editor – where cut paste will only paste plain text.

Alternatively, If you’re in the Visual Editor then … Click the W icon and paste there first.
