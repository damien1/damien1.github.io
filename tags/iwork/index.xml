      <description>I started the week with the ambition to just use iWork for a week. Today’s Tuesday and now I see the #failure of such a challenge.iWork Pages can’t convert Word documents so easily I’ve been sent a word document to review for a friend – that should be easy as iWork opens Microsoft Office Word .docx formats. The document opens ok … but the content has been placed into separate textblocks on the page just like any traditional desktop publishing app would do – but of course this was supposed to be a document that needed to be cleaned up.</description>

      <description>Having cleaned up my Macbook Pro and reformatted the hard drive … I’m going to spend the week using iWorkfor all my document needs. I’m a smart guy … I know I love Office for Mac(powerpoint makes any presentation look hot) – but maybe I can be doing sexy presentations in Keynote instead.So I’ve not got Office on my Mac and will let you know – I anticipate that I’ll be frustrated by Pages and its desktop publishing layouts but I should get used to that quickly.</description>
