      <description>when writing about or thinking about the future start by writing these words ‘in the future’ or maybe ‘Wouldn’t it be cool, if in the future’.
Remember back at school doing free writing or projects on people in space. Teachers would always get you to write about the future and using the phrase ‘in the future’ sets you directly to writing about that.
So thinking about the future is not about tomorrow, next month or next year.</description>

      <description>In a few years time, many of us will want to retire … what’s going to happen to us and our communities we live in if suddenly todays 20 and 30 somethings are 80? What music or digital entertainment will there be? Remembering also that as we start ‘age’ we will have to work later in life beyond today’s retirement age.If, the aging population is bigger than the younger generation – does that mean nightclubs, discos and places like Ibiza will become the place for the 70+ age group?</description>
