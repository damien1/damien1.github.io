      <description>Welcome and say hello to empty. empty is a bunch of ANT Build Tasks for WordPress plugin developers that help automate the build thanks to Apache Ant.
Why ANT not PHING? Go ask Google that ‚Ä¶ there are plenty of conversations elsewhere on ANT vs PHING. It‚Äôs really a personal choice.
Ant, Phing, Grunt.js, make are all build tools for developers. Ant is a popular tool, free and widely used. It‚Äôs commonly used for Java but can fit in with other code and projects.</description>

      <description>Comment ‚Äì Seems to me that ‚Äòeveryone‚Äô wants to find a fault with Google+ and many maybe ‚Äòwishing‚Äô it to fail. It‚Äôs hard to get traction with social networks as we are likely to be regular users of a few social networks. It‚Äôs harder still to get people to change their primary social network of choice when your online social network all still use The Facebook.
