      <description>**2010 has been and gone … so it&amp;rsquo;s time to welcome 2011. It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy year even though it had no deviation of its 365 expected length in days. I guess 2010 just had more tough days then easy days! What do you think?**

      <description>So September has been and gone and now we are into October … The annoying thing about October is that half the world is celebrating spring and half the world is thinking about the last few weeks of summer time 🙁and in other news - I&amp;rsquo;m back in the UK after spending summer working in Lithuania. Which means it must be time to start organising drinks and networking stuff around Startup Weekend again.</description>
