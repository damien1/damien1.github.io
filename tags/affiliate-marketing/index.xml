      <description>I just added the Skimlinkswordpress plugin to my site. Skimlinks is my first step into affiliate marketing (is that what it is?). The wordpress plugin was very easy to install â€“ but I think I should have read up more on affiliate marketing so it was over to the NMA magazine who recently ran an special on affiliate marketing to help me out.
In essence, affiliate marketing involves any 3rd party creating content that is linked to a product page and the affiliate gets a commission for the sale.</description>
