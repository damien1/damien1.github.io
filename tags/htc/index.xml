      <description>Develop apps for Android or develop mobile apps for Apple, some days its hard to figure out just what to do. On this website I‚Äôve written a lot on Android phones and apps.Around 6000 apps have been removed from the Apple store recently due to their erotic nature. It‚Äôs not that Android Market has no quality control ‚Äì Adult or Erotic does not exist as a content category in Android Market but dating apps or other soft-porn apps so far have not shown huge growth (ahem) on Android.</description>

      <description>Recently the blogosphere has gone a bit crazy, excuse my lack of hyperbole about the Android platform. Was this ‚ÄòAndroid‚Äô supposed to do battle with the iPhone?
Just because no operators or manufacturers have openly commented about their smart phone sales figures doesn‚Äôt mean its bad news. Looking at the number of Android powered phones out now or due in the next 2 months shows a lot of promise
 HTC Hero ‚Äì some bloggers say it‚Äôs the best Android yet G1 ‚Äì the funny one with the flip out keyboard, still only with T-Mobile Magic ‚Äì Vodafone took this and the Android platform global Tattoo ‚Äì coming out again to Vodafone before xmas Motorola DEXT ‚Äì a lifesaver for Motorola ‚Äì probably the phone that saves them.</description>
