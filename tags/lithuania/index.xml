      <description>Lithuania is a basketball crazy nation – which may seem odd if you know little about this newer European Union state. Lithuania has had a long history with basketball even in the days of the Soviet Union (USSR).
Lithuania will also be hosting the Mens European Championships in summer 2011. Something to look forward too. I guess as the days grow darker and colder, indoor team sports like Basketball are good for the fans and the players.</description>

      <description>Foursquaretoday is the most popular mobile checkin app in Vilnius, Lithuania. While not everyone here can afford the iPhone – many people are using Foursquare on their Blackberry.
Point of note – Blackberry App World is not available in Lithuania and so people are using hacks to install this.
Here’s a couple of screenshots from Checkin Mania confirming the number of venues is great in Foursquare vs Gowalla in the central old town area.</description>

      <description>In Vilnius, the capital city of Lithuania its youth get up to no good. Just like all young people do! Here’s a few photos from the last week to prove how bad these youngsters can be.
Vilnius main drag @4pm on the HOTTEST day (ever) is deserted cause word had got around that 2 skate boarding youth were taking over the town.

Vilnius main tourist attraction is its iconic cathedral and separate bell tower, in this shot the youth of today are street dancing!</description>

      <description>In Lithuania mobile penetration is almost at 150% – so is this all from younger people sim swapping?

Mobile Youth in Lithuania (16-24 yo) are all using multi-sims for the best deals and free calls. The 3 main operators are Omnitel, Bite and Tele2. Freedom of choice means that handsets are not subsidised very much and customers have to pay full price for a phone. Even the the ‘popular’ iPhone is over priced and still exclusive with one operator and on a 24 month contract.</description>

      <title>Lithuanian Youth love to use the Internet</title>

      <description>In Lithuania the usage of the internet is reaching saturation point. A 2009 official report shows 95% of young people aged 16-24 with internet access**.**
Lithuania has one of the highest per capita access to broadband ratios due to small land mass and population of just under 4 million. It’s also atypical of ‘westernised’ European markets and the Lithuanian youth are no different – wanting mobile phones, good clothes, good education and a future with a good job (most likely in London).</description>

      <description>From: Our intrepid report
Location: Vilnius, Lithuania
Date: 8 August 2010
This could sound like the start of yet another long worded PR update with little to say and lots of flowery prose. Who I am to say if I write long winded rambling sentences with little or no meaning?
But anyway – I digress, Ill be working for a couple of months in Lithuania (yes in the East of Eastern Europe near the Baltic Sea).</description>
