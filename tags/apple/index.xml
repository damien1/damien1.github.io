      <description>Reformatting a computer is usually an emotionally distressful activity – involving losing files, trying to find software discs and panic about lost licence codes.
Over the years, I’ve reformatted and deleted many computers – kind of like giving your computer a semi annual service. As a result of noticing something not running right .. it just has to be done.
Today’s reformat went faster then I expected.
Reformat your Apple Mac and reinstall OSx operating system Once you are happy that you have moved all the files you think you want to keep … All you do is:</description>

I woke up this morning .. it’s pouring with rain … my Apple MacBook Pro decides it doesn’t want to connect to my wifi.
So I had to do, what I had to do! and reformatted my Mac.
Now … I’m getting up in running again.
First things first ..
 Update my user preferences and move my home folder to the second partition (done) Download and Install Chrome (done) Download and Install Dropbox – point to my Dropbox folder on the other partition Download and install 1Password (done)  </description>

      <description>I’ve just started to use Jenkins as part of a continuous integration setup that I’m building. Mostly I’m doing this to learn and then apply this to something bigger. At home, I’m using Jenkins as a CI server to manage testing of my PHP WordPress plugins. I know it could be overkill, but as a one man band, automating testing is something that saves me time and increases my confidence that the development feature is tested and ready to deploy!</description>

      <description>To me, I used Apple Maps on my iPad to check walking directions. So why is Apple Maps now powered by a Sat nav company like TomTom. Apparently I have to pay tollS to walk 6m to my home … Not just one toll … That&amp;rsquo;s tolls.
And annoyingly all map data is now from some sat nav company so you can&amp;rsquo;t get walking directions.</description>

      <description>I’ve been using Apple Macbook Pro as my primary work horse since 2008. I’ve always had ClamXav installed as a ‘heuristic’ solution to monitor apps and downloads for virus and malware.
I’m a fan of sandbox for apps, but as I do develop a whole heap of different things, just installing from the Mac App Store is not an option for me.
Now I’m going to look for other software ….</description>

      <description>What was your first computer? The first computer I had regular use of was kept locked up in my school’s library. It was an Apple IIe with a green monochrome monitor. At 9 years of age, I was hooked.

Growing up far, far away where the most important news of the day was NZ losing its number 1 market for dairy and lamb as the UK joined the ‘EU’ – a piece of technology like the Apple IIe probably cost the world.</description>

Something borrowed or something blue? Apple, Lion &amp;amp; iOS5 Does Apple’s new software tickle your fancy? does the idea of conjoined operating systems for mobile and computers excite you?

      <description>Apple has updated its Aperture software to 3.1.2 – it seems to focus on the new users who quite likely brought the Appstore copy.
The release note is not very useful – but maybe the adjustments will be interesting to see what happens.

      <description>I’ve been using Apple Aperture 3 for my digital photography and image processing for a couple of years. It’s great for importing those images for clients and quickly doing all the editing, tagging, grouping and touch-ups.
What I didn’t like about it as a workflow tool – is that it lacks proper integration with Flickr. In the 3.0 version from last year you could publish as a Set of photos to Flickr, but couldn’t just add an image to your photostream.</description>

      <description>It was only earlier this week that Apple’s homepage changed to advertise the fact that a 10 billion milestone was soon to be reached.
It wouldn’t be insane to think that 10 billion app downloads is a milestone and a half – no other app store or mobile operator portal has reported such impressive download figures.
In other recent news e-marketer reckoned that we all had a collective average of 60 of these apps on our smartphones — that’s a lot of games, news, branded content and generally important little bits of code on our phones.</description>

      <description>So .. Thanks to Amazon and Royal Mail at 730am I received my copy of Office for Mac 2011. Most obvious change is that the floating palette or toolbox is gone, replaced by the Ribbon which has been in Windows Version for a few years.
It now seems way way faster … Once one office app is open, the others open bleedingly fast. So they must now share more of a common backend.</description>

      <description>I started the week with the ambition to just use iWork for a week. Today’s Tuesday and now I see the #failure of such a challenge.iWork Pages can’t convert Word documents so easily I’ve been sent a word document to review for a friend – that should be easy as iWork opens Microsoft Office Word .docx formats. The document opens ok … but the content has been placed into separate textblocks on the page just like any traditional desktop publishing app would do – but of course this was supposed to be a document that needed to be cleaned up.</description>

      <description>Having cleaned up my Macbook Pro and reformatted the hard drive … I’m going to spend the week using iWorkfor all my document needs. I’m a smart guy … I know I love Office for Mac(powerpoint makes any presentation look hot) – but maybe I can be doing sexy presentations in Keynote instead.So I’ve not got Office on my Mac and will let you know – I anticipate that I’ll be frustrated by Pages and its desktop publishing layouts but I should get used to that quickly.</description>

I had felt that it was starting to run a bit slow than ‘normal’ and I recently had a problem with a kernel panic (caused when testing a up to 21mb USB modem). So I have a ‘clean’ new computer and that has also given me a chance to think about what to reinstall.</description>

      <description>Develop apps for Android or develop mobile apps for Apple, some days its hard to figure out just what to do. On this website I’ve written a lot on Android phones and apps.Around 6000 apps have been removed from the Apple store recently due to their erotic nature. It’s not that Android Market has no quality control – Adult or Erotic does not exist as a content category in Android Market but dating apps or other soft-porn apps so far have not shown huge growth (ahem) on Android.</description>

      <description>Where to start with building a mobile app or going mobile has been a popular topic for some time. Many FMCG brands and agencies are requesting only quotes for mobile apps – forgetting the less popular java app or branded mobile game. At the expense of budget – haha – focusing on a mobile app can be a costly exercise starting from about 10k to 100k plus.
Marketing Agencies and their Brands need to go and reconsider their mobile strategy – and if you’ve already built a mobile app – you maybe disappointed how it looks on the larger screen devices.</description>

Best Apps for your Mac  ClamXav – still the best and most recommended free virus protection for your mac Adium – pronounced like stadium, this is the multi chat application for the mac Skype – for free calls to the office and home Dropbox – for sharing files between the office and clients Mac Office 2008 – word, powerpoint and to some extent excel, because all my templates are Office based and the guys in the office use PC’s.</description>

      <description>Sounds like good news in the UK market ‘opening’ up to more distribution channels for the iPhone. Tesco’s annouced it plans to start selling the iPhone by the end of the year and promised to add value to the market, where prices are stagnating between O2 and Orange.
What this means is that Tesco will be just another distributor like the Carphone Warehouse — and so at first, it didn’t seem clear if customers will have a choice of O2 or Orange.</description>

      <description>With the boom in the number of apps in the App Store (over 100,000) and total downloads in excess of 2bn … someone has got to be making money … right?In part, the iPhone does offer a better platform for apps – it’s about to overtake RIM as the leading consumer smartphone, sold more than 34 million units and got some of the highest mobile internet usage rates we’ve seen so far.</description>

      <description>XNJB: is the app of the day for people who have used MP3 players from Creative technology. Moving to a Mac I was at a lose as to how to copy music to my Creative Zen and how to charge my Creative on my Mac.
This is where XNJB comes to the rescue and lets you copy music or charge your Creative while running Mac OSX 10.6 Snow Leopard.
XNJB should be bundled with Creative Media Players … after all these years and all the marketing hype around the Mac not having official support for Mac is sometimes a death knell or ‘dirge’ for any brand.</description>

      <description>Following on yesterday’s news that Orange Uk will start selling iPhone … ending O2 / Telefonica’s virtual monopoly in the UK. Today, Vodafone in UK and Ireland announced their plans to sell Apple iPhones.
Good news for the operators? well ending the monopoly of iPhone was a good move. An operator with a data usage strategy will want to be selling iPhones along side other data hungry phones like RIM, Android, Symbian devices.</description>

      <description>The snipping tool has to be one of the best features introduced into Windows Vista (except for the nasty red line around the pictures). PRT-SCRN is now a thing of the past. But what do you do when your Mac doesnt even have a PRT SCRN key? Press any key ? ? ? ?
CMD+SHIFT+4 is the combination to remember .. and then press the space bar if you want a screen shot of the current window</description>

      <description>Now that you’ve ripped and digitised all of your CD library – what do you do with your CD’s? One idea is to create a catalogue and then you can box or put away (or recycle) your CD’s and DVD’s giving you much more space to fill with books, CD’s or other stuff.If you’re like me, I’ve been ripping all my CD’s for years and the CD and cases were just collecting dust in my room.</description>

      <description>I’ve been using keyboard shortcuts for Microsoft Office on Windows for years. So here I am now using Mac Office on a Macbook Pro and still trying to figure out how to get around the keyboard.Tip of the Day – Windows Excel Alt+Enter and in Mac Office Excel keyboard shortcut is Fn+Ctrl+Alt
This adds a carriage return within the current cell and its great for doing long text entry in 1 cell.</description>

      <description>Assuming you have been using Virtualbox before, then the upgrade process to Virtualbox 3 is going to be easy and smooth sailing.
For first time users of Virtualbox or in fact virtualisation who are using a Mac OSx then you should read my earlier posts on how to get going. These are:

      <description>So its Happy Birthday to Apple and its App Store – 1 year old. Its created a new industry and probably will change the way everyone digests content – now that everything has an app or a widget you dont need to browse for it.
Except for Search – Apple and the Apps store has changed how mobile phone manufacturers think about content like Nokia, RIM and Sony Ericsson all launched (or launching) app stores in the past 3 months.</description>

So Grab your Windows 7 RC1 ISO file from the Windows website, grab a copy of Virtualbox for Mac and get going.</description>

      <description> comment: The reason that Apple charges different retail prices in each market is due to the differences in wholesale prices charged in each market by the major labels. Apple could use this as leverage against the labels to lower their prices in all major EU markets
