      <description>Mobile usage in the UK is on the increase. That’s all sounding good so far.
The latest communications report from Ofcom has shown a year on year growth of 1.6 million mobiles and the biggest growth in postpaid subscribers due to more customers taking out contracts for smartphones.

      <description>Just in time for Christmas – after 6 years of being harangued at Passport Control, questioned a million times and having to cough up around a £1000 a year for the past 3 years, I can now say I’m a whinging Pom. 
And on my first day of being a Citizen of the United Kingdom — I was stumped by this piece of poor user experience design when applying for my British Passport.</description>

      <description>This news from Hutchison 3G UK shows that using social media is more important on their mobile network is interesting …. Keeping up to date with friends or regular gameplay on the move is now more important than checking emails or reading the news. 
In my opinion, Social Networking continues to dominate growth in internet usage – however, you shouldn’t assume that its all fun on the go. Social Media sites like Twitter, Facebook and LinkedInare all used for b2b leads and d2c customer service.</description>

Of the 908 online shoppers that were asked about their mobile shopping habits, 66 percent owned a Smartphone or another Web-enabled phone.

      <title>Foursquare most popular location checkin game in London</title>

      <description>Foursquare is still the UK’s most popular location based check-in game to play on your mobile. I’ve said it before that Foursquare would come out on tops over Gowalla and Brightkite.
These maps (thanks to Checkin Mania) indicate the difference in the number of locations that users have submitted to each service. The growth from crowd sourced locations and points of interest reflects in the growth of that services usage (ie the most popular service gets the most contributions from users) The point of reference is London Borough Market – one of the more famous places in London to visit.</description>

      <title>What kids do online: UK Internet Usage</title>

      <description>Recent indepth report from New Media Age in the UK focused on the internet usage habits of kids.
Kids research is hard – the age group is from 7 – 13. They are already exposed to a lot of marketing, aware of trends and ‘peer pressure’, but still very much aware of having to please their parents all of the time. It’s also very difficult to ask questions about anything anti-social, illegal due to the young age and formative, questioning minds.</description>

      <description>With the boom in the number of apps in the App Store (over 100,000) and total downloads in excess of 2bn … someone has got to be making money … right?In part, the iPhone does offer a better platform for apps – it’s about to overtake RIM as the leading consumer smartphone, sold more than 34 million units and got some of the highest mobile internet usage rates we’ve seen so far.</description>

      <description>The UK for along time has been a country full of honours and award systems — the most CCTV cameras comes to mind and from today it seems that the UK Government believes that for your safety, they will need to record details and the contents of every SMS, email, voicemails and phone calls.
How afraid are we all becoming?

      <description>Comment: Datz music lounge has come out for Xmas in the UK with a £99.99 unlimited music DRM free offer. So whats the hooks … plenty even before you get going.
So Datz announced unlimited DRM Free music downloads (legally) this week … the service has an upfront fee of £99.99 – probably too steep for most people to consider – but maybe Sainsburys thinks it will be a last minute stocking stuffer.</description>
