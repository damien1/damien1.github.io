      <description>I’ve been writing about Android for some time now. Here are 4 of the best Android apps for Wifi. These apps allow you to find public wi-fi networks, turn your phone into a wifi hotspot and a bit more.
HTC Wifi Hotspot This app can’t be downloaded from the market – its part of HTC build for Android 2.2 Froyo
I’ve used this loads of times – its great for getting my laptop or iPad on the Internet when needed, but the main point to remember is it kills your battery very fast.</description>

      <description>I’ve been writing about Android for some time now and Best Android Apps for Wifi is a very popular post. So here is a refreshingly new look for 2011 at some of the best wi-fi apps for your smartphone.
Auto Wifi Enabler This was a fav app for a month – til I realised I only ever needed 2 wifi hotspots – the one at work and the one at home.</description>

      <description>Managing wifi on your Android mobile phonecan be a hassle, so at least there are now 3 good apps for you to use to make your wifi experience better.
##Wifinder
Is the most technical looking of the 3 apps – turning it on was a bit of shock when compared to the user experience of the other 2 apps. WiFinder only has 1 button aptly labelled New Scan. You then press and hold on the WiFi SSID to see the more familar Android Wifi Connect.</description>

It’s very easy to change this setting and I prefer to keep wifi on when the phone is plugged into the mains power, this means your news and rss clients will synced overnight when you’re sleeping.</description>
