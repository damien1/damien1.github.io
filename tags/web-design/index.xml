      <description>WordPressis one of the most popular solutions for blogging. What people don’t know is that WordPress self hosted is the best solution for building a standalone B2B or SME company website. We recently finished the migration of the mmCHANNEL company website from an in-house developed website (using PHP, etc) to single install, self hosted WordPress installation.
There were a few times when I felt that maybe WordPress wasn’t right, but overall it’s going great and the results are visible!</description>

      <description>I’m not one to always login to Facebook … It’s a good week if I don’t log in at all. But for about 500 million people Facebook is pretty important.
As if Facebook really needed to tell you to bookmark their site if you already go there – but this bookmarket / on-site advertising is a fresh change to the usual page prompting you to login from your mobile.

      <description>Hello 2011 — long may you last! If you’re new to my site … then Hello to you too. It’s time for a spring clean and over the next few days, I’ll be tearing everything apart on the website.
In the first stage, I have taken down the old WordPress website and replaced it with a WordPress Network or Multisite – which means I can make a network of blogs or websites … or more likely microsites for social media marketing campaigns and promotions.</description>

      <description>Sketchbook Pro, in my opinion is the best iPad app for photo editing, graphic and web design. And its new update just makes it better. The new release makes it a great all round tool for note taking, wireframe and web design.
A Power tool for notes, sketches and mockups I like to think I’m a pro digital photographer so I like my photo software to do amazing things – even if I cant.</description>

      <description>Balsamiq – I love it – the fonts and stuff can seem a bit cheesy … but I’ve take to this like a duck to water. Its much more useful than powerpoint, visio or other tools as its designed for wireframing.
Being built on Adobe Air means anyone can use it.
It’s very quick to create a UE design and while I couldn’t find a template or mockup for cell phone / mobile phone.</description>
