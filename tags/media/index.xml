      <description>Engagement metrics and CPE are going to become more popular this year and next year, and so how do you take the offline world online? Or how can you start track the value of that billboard you just spent 10,000,000 dollars on?
Well that looks obvious! So how are you tracking offline to online engagement?
At the moment Bit.ly Pro offers free service - you provide a customer domain or sub domain and it does the rest.</description>

      <description>You can try to avoid watching this advert all you want - but you just got to know what it is that Bill and Jerry cooked up here in the Shoe Circus - Windows Vista advert
.
Really does the ad say much - No … Does it try to convince you to switch - No … but maybe its a brand ad and not a product ad
Lots of talk of quality, runs tight, last, endurance and other words in the ad - so maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll see them more in the &amp;lsquo;product ads&amp;rsquo; when they come out?</description>
