      <description>I started the week with the ambition to just use iWork for a week. Today&amp;rsquo;s Tuesday and now I see the #failure of such a challenge.iWork Pages can&amp;rsquo;t convert Word documents so easily I&amp;rsquo;ve been sent a word document to review for a friend - that should be easy as iWork opens Microsoft Office Word .docx formats. The document opens ok … but the content has been placed into separate textblocks on the page just like any traditional desktop publishing app would do - but of course this was supposed to be a document that needed to be cleaned up.</description>

      <description>Having cleaned up my Macbook Pro and reformatted the hard drive … I&amp;rsquo;m going to spend the week using iWorkfor all my document needs. I&amp;rsquo;m a smart guy … I know I love Office for Mac(powerpoint makes any presentation look hot) - but maybe I can be doing sexy presentations in Keynote instead.So I&amp;rsquo;ve not got Office on my Mac and will let you know - I anticipate that I&amp;rsquo;ll be frustrated by Pages and its desktop publishing layouts but I should get used to that quickly.</description>
