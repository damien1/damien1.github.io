      <description>In WordPress going mobile is easy … you could actually find that your website theme is already Responsive, so maybe &amp;lsquo;doing nothing&amp;rsquo; is a valid answer.
What are your choices to mobilise a WordPress Website? You have 4 choices
 Choose a Responsive Theme for your site (Responsive adapts for different screen sizes) most work from WooThemes is now responsive. Choose a plugin like WPTouchPro which is both plugin and theme) Build a second site which you access at m.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a member of the Design Museum here in Londonand so it was nice to see they have a free app with collection of the best pieces. It does remind me of the Phaidon Design Classics book-as-an-app (which still has not been changed since the first iPad).
I like this application and I was researching text overflow and scrolling. Since iPad no longer shows scrollbars then it&amp;rsquo;s up to the user to figure what is scrolling or not.</description>

      <title>App Design Review of Evernote&#39;s First Time User Guide</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not often that we (as app user or developers) stop to consider how important the First Time User experience or the Getting Started Guide is.
If you had never heard of Evernote (or many other apps) then you rely on this introduction to do a lot of things. To sum it up, the first time user experience has to do two things:
 sell the customer that the app will do what the user thinks it will do (they&amp;rsquo;ve already installed it but app store descriptions can be misleading), and; tell the customer how to use it  Ultimately, large multi-platform applications have many, many, more features then there is time for a Quick Start Guide or First Time User experience.</description>

      <title>Axure - workflow for business process &amp;#038; web applications</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to jump in the deep end with Axure and start building wireframes and hi-fi clickable prototypes. But the joy of Axure is starting low-fi (use Post-It Notes) to map a user journey and then create this process flow in Axure. Following a workflow like this means you get the customer journey mapped and you easily link your Axure wireframes to business processes.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Axure for more than a year and it&amp;rsquo;s now my tool of choice for mapping customer journeys and user interaction design.</description>

      <title>Using Axure for wireframes &amp;#038; user experience</title>

      <description>Recently I discovered Axure as a tool for mapping user experience - and I have to say it&amp;rsquo;s pretty damn good. Given that its also able to generate clickable prototypes along with documentation like functional specifications this is more then pretty damn good. It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful tool - but if you&amp;rsquo;re building user journeys, wire framing and process flows can be easier to do in other tools.
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to compare Axure to Balsamiq, Visio or Omnigraffle - particularly on price since Axure starts at around $580 per licence.</description>

      <description>WordPress is a great tool. It has its own way of managing updates to your website - and will switch to maintenance mode automatically. For the best user experience you should enable maintenance mode yourself.

      <title>A quick overview Balsamiq Mockups</title>

      <description>Mobile user experience and interface design is tricky business at the best of time. You need tools and templates that can help quickly sketch or mockup what things will look like which is where Balsamiq comes in.
Back in 2008 I started to use Balsamiq Mockups for sketches of mobile UX/UI for mobile operator content portals. This isn&amp;rsquo;t easy work at the best of times. Launched in June 2008, Mockups helps software designers and developers build great software by letting them easily sketch out their ideas, then quickly collaborate and iterate over them.</description>

      <description>Google recently announced some exciting new features for Android 3.0 Honeycomb. Most notably, Android 3.0 sees tablets and mobile devices merge to the same code base. This is kind of like having one OS for all devices. There are interface design considerations that need to be understood before launching your app on the big screen.

      <description>SketchBook Mobile recently got a mention here as the best iPad app fro sketches, notes, photos and more … and now its available on Android. I bet if you have a Samsung Galaxy Tab - this should be the first app that really is worth paying for.With so many features - it can be hard to know where to start - so my suggestion is use it to play around with some of your photos.</description>

      <description>Balsamiq - I love it - the fonts and stuff can seem a bit cheesy … but I&amp;rsquo;ve take to this like a duck to water. Its much more useful than powerpoint, visio or other tools as its designed for wireframing.
Being built on Adobe Air means anyone can use it.
It&amp;rsquo;s very quick to create a UE design and while I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a template or mockup for cell phone / mobile phone.</description>
