      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a member of the Design Museum here in Londonand so it was nice to see they have a free app with collection of the best pieces. It does remind me of the Phaidon Design Classics book-as-an-app (which still has not been changed since the first iPad).
I like this application and I was researching text overflow and scrolling. Since iPad no longer shows scrollbars then it&amp;rsquo;s up to the user to figure what is scrolling or not.</description>

      <description>I recently started using Axure for wire framing and creating clickable prototypes. I enjoyed it so much that I started to put together my own project for the Apple iPad with masters and a basic set of wireframes.
FREE Download iPad Axure Project Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s a free download and can be used under Creative Commons - CC-Attribution and you can use it for commercial and non-commercial projects. Just let me know please.</description>

      <title>Using Axure for wireframes &amp;#038; user experience</title>

      <description>Recently I discovered Axure as a tool for mapping user experience - and I have to say it&amp;rsquo;s pretty damn good. Given that its also able to generate clickable prototypes along with documentation like functional specifications this is more then pretty damn good. It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful tool - but if you&amp;rsquo;re building user journeys, wire framing and process flows can be easier to do in other tools.
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to compare Axure to Balsamiq, Visio or Omnigraffle - particularly on price since Axure starts at around $580 per licence.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll start by saying I&amp;rsquo;m a gadget boy â€” any marketing consultant working on innovation or product delivery has got to know about gadgets. When I got my first iPad last year, I quickly realised that my finger tip was useless for writing. I&amp;rsquo;ve been collecting styli or styluses and starting to get a good collection.
I have been stopped plenty of times to be asked what&amp;rsquo;s my preferred tool and over the past 12 months, I&amp;rsquo;ve used quite a few and thrown out some immediately.</description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t got an iPad or still not convinced you&amp;rsquo;ll need one - then you&amp;rsquo;re kidding yourself. As a marketing consultant new gadgets like the iPad need to be purchased, used extensively and then replaced with the next new shiny gadget. Why - you might ask? Because how else can you have an opinion or recommend a solution to your clients.
Today - I&amp;rsquo;m taking a quick look at the list of apps featured in iTunes under the category &amp;lsquo;business class&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Sketchbook Pro, in my opinion is the best iPad app for photo editing, graphic and web design. And its new update just makes it better. The new release makes it a great all round tool for note taking, wireframe and web design.
A Power tool for notes, sketches and mockups I like to think I&amp;rsquo;m a pro digital photographer so I like my photo software to do amazing things - even if I cant.</description>

      <title>Where to start building mobile apps for large screens - mobile agencies beware</title>

      <description>Where to start with building a mobile app or going mobile has been a popular topic for some time. Many FMCG brands and agencies are requesting only quotes for mobile apps - forgetting the less popular java app or branded mobile game. At the expense of budget - haha - focusing on a mobile app can be a costly exercise starting from about 10k to 100k plus.
Marketing Agencies and their Brands need to go and reconsider their mobile strategy - and if you&amp;rsquo;ve already built a mobile app - you maybe disappointed how it looks on the larger screen devices.</description>
