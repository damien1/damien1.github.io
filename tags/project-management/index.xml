      <description>There really is nothing better then looking at your office wall and knowing that done is done.
Post-it Note management has to be one of the easiest and most effective ways to create a wall board – information radiator – which you and your management can all follow.</description>

      <description>It’s here again – Social Media Sunday and this week I have chosen 3 of the best Google Apps for social networking and project management.

If you don’t use Google Apps with a custom domain … then you don’t know what you are missing.
Socialwok 
Socialwok creates a professional social network instantly for everyone on the same domain. You can also create projects or shared folders (called Feeds) and invite external people — clients?</description>

      <description>As I’m a certified Scrum Master and very good at project and task management I can say I enjoy running planning sessions with teams I do work with. Now I’ve started to discover the freedom of the Post-It Note for planning and brainstorming.

Even better, its essential for any startup to be able to focus on what has to be done and avoid distractions like outsiders wanting extra work or changes to scope.</description>
