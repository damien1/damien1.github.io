      <description>Are you responsible for Twitter and Social Media in your business? Perhaps you’ve been feeling a bit lost after CoTweet closed its free version (shame on them) … here are a few alternatives you can look at
HootSuite
– yes I said alternative to CoTweet – personally, I like to use my own bit.ly Pro URL so this was not an option. – Hootsuitehas a very reasonably priced premium version and it has clients for pretty much any device</description>

      <description>So what do you think of the new look for Twitter? It’s feeling cleaner and the style change adds some freshness.
But is this the first step in the wrong direction for brand pages? Will we all end-up with old-skool MySpace style pages?</description>

      <description>Twitter for business marketing is a love or hate tool – and I love to love Twitter. Auto Follow and Auto DM are two topics that with a passion, divides Social Media Marketers. I recently trialled Auto-Followafter I was told that I was distant for not doing so.
Results Prove Dont Auto Follow I have not Auto-Followed Twitterers for some time – as I try to focus on building some relationship (!</description>

      <description>CoTweet provides the easiest way for your business to start managing your company or brand on Twitter. If you already are using HootSuite or Tweetdeck you should stop for a minute and check you are doing the right thing for your business. CoTweetis designed for the multi-user / multi-site (!!) environment with assignment, archiving and other management tools – this means you’ll never lose a tweet again (or have to share the computer with your boss).</description>

      <description>Are Twitter Followers better than Facebook Fanswas a topic discussed on emarketer recently. It’s a question I get asked all the time – relatively speaking – Which is the best social network to start social media marketing? The thing is you need to try them both at the same time.And here is the problem every social network has its pro’s and cons – and here is the answer. If you were a criminal, on trial in the Old Bailey, the prosecution’s job is to prove you had the intention of committing a crime, so it was just an accident.</description>
