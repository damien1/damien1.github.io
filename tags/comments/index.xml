      <description>It is easy to stop most WordPress comment spam instantly with one small change to your theme’s functions.php. This is one of my favourite WordPress functions and I use it on all my setups.
This code snippet works by blocking comments from being added offsite or indirectly and not from the comment box on your webpage. Most spammers try to automate their ‘workload’ and try to exploit WordPress functions that allow you to manage comments or add posts via the WordPress API’s.</description>

      <description>Recently I moaned about the state of comments and spam – and I hinted that comments would be enabled across my website again.
My interests in social media do extend to ‘the Facebook’ – but my expertise is definitely not with that network. Given a limited number of hours in each day, I have enough social media stuff to do.
Facebook Comments Only a few months back, Facebook launched their own comments system allowing external websites an easy way to integrate with Facebooks own commenting system.</description>

Akismet the only rubber you need In WordPress – part of the battle is won by using the free Akismet plugin which is developed and maintained by Automattic (the ‘commercial arm’ of WordPress.com etc).</description>
