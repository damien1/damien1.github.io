      <description>Hi … if you’re looking at this in your RSS feed reader will now notice at the bottom of each post there is now a Google Adsense ad.
 Last week I turned on Google Adsense - initially for my RSS feed. The reason I’m doing this is to learn and test different ad formats and learn how to manage and use Google Adsense.
I’ll be better able to advise you on your social media and digital marketing strategy by using products like Google Adsense.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m the type who is always overwhelmed by TV advertising- as I don&amp;rsquo;t watch &amp;lsquo;live&amp;rsquo; TV or commercial TV with ads I often find myself watching adverts on the internet for the sake of it! I even occasionally, download these adverts to save them and watch them again and again and again and …Can I just say I&amp;rsquo;m against flashmobs, my new found British sensibility (*read - I&amp;rsquo;ve just handed in my UK citizenship application) does not condone such public displays - it&amp;rsquo;s embarrassing and I was overexposed to the last T-mobile flashmob thanks to my gyms in-house digital signage.</description>

      <description>You can try to avoid watching this advert all you want - but you just got to know what it is that Bill and Jerry cooked up here in the Shoe Circus - Windows Vista advert
.
Really does the ad say much - No … Does it try to convince you to switch - No … but maybe its a brand ad and not a product ad
Lots of talk of quality, runs tight, last, endurance and other words in the ad - so maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll see them more in the &amp;lsquo;product ads&amp;rsquo; when they come out?</description>
