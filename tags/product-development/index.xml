      <title>Using Axure for wireframes &amp;#038; user experience</title>

      <description>Recently I discovered Axure as a tool for mapping user experience – and I have to say it’s pretty damn good. Given that its also able to generate clickable prototypes along with documentation like functional specifications this is more then pretty damn good. It’s a powerful tool – but if you’re building user journeys, wire framing and process flows can be easier to do in other tools.
It’s hard to compare Axure to Balsamiq, Visio or Omnigraffle – particularly on price since Axure starts at around $580 per licence.</description>

      <description>If you’re about to head off for some sun – do pack these 2 books so you can say you seriously did some ‘work’.
Why Do I need to know these books? You need to know about current tools and the best practices as they are already appearing in many business plans, marketing strategy or new product definitions.
If you evaluate startups and are not getting a business model canvas then you should tell them to go re-write their business pan.</description>
