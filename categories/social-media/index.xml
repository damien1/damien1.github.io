      <description>Social Media marketing - using Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Google+ … needs to form part of any marketing plan across the marketing mix. Treating Social Media as a separate activity from the rest of your marketing is a No-No … In fact social media should be integrated into every campaign or promotion.
Digital marketing fits into new customer acquisition, customer retention, CRM, customer engagement and loyalty and anything else that customers do and thats true for D2C brands as well as B2B marketers.</description>

      <description>Comment - Seems to me that &amp;lsquo;everyone&amp;rsquo; wants to find a fault with Google+ and many maybe &amp;lsquo;wishing&amp;rsquo; it to fail. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to get traction with social networks as we are likely to be regular users of a few social networks. It&amp;rsquo;s harder still to get people to change their primary social network of choice when your online social network all still use The Facebook.

      <title>Best Tools for Social Media Marketing if you&#39;re just getting started</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re getting started with Social Media marketing then you need at least 1 web based tool to help you.
For most businesses and individuals, social media marketing starts and ends with Tweetdeck. Which provides an all-in-one solution for pushing content direct from your machine. You need better tools for planning and managing your social media marketing.
However browser based tools for social media marketing are better suited for team or office environs - or if you&amp;rsquo;re like me, someone on the road in different offices who can&amp;rsquo;t have Tweetdeck open all the time.</description>

      <description>The second release candidate for the next version of WordPress 3.2 is here. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t started testing 3.2, now is the time. Previous experience would make this the final RC before the real deal.
 Should I update to this release candidate? As this is a release candidate you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t use this on a really important live site - but it does mean it&amp;rsquo;s pretty stable and useful. You should find that most popular plugins and themes have no issues as developers have been working since RC1.</description>

      <description>The team at Emailvision have contacted me a lot in the past 3 days … since I wrote a short article on cross channel campaign problems and a lack of testing.
I will say that Emailvision team that I have spoken to have all been great - it&amp;rsquo;s good to know they switched on people who are passionate about their company and what they do.

      <title>What Could we do better? Short Web Survey from KISS Insights</title>

      <description>What could we do to make this site more useful? That&amp;rsquo;s a good question … and thanks to Kiss Insights its really easy to ask this of your website visitors.
It&amp;rsquo;s only one answer &amp;amp; takes one second Web surveys should not be a bore and they should not be too long. We&amp;rsquo;re all so busy now and being asked to spend 15 mins on a survey is pointless.
I guess that&amp;rsquo;s what makes the KISS approach so powerful - keep it short and simple.</description>

      <description>Digital marketing has its benefits mainly that it’s easy to launch a social media campaign without any prior relationship with the victim.
I’m more annoyed at the damage young companies do to their brand, reputation and domain-name … at wasted opportunities from legitimate startups who just spam any contacts in one e-mail blast.
Last week, I got an email sent to me with someone elses info - yet it was an invite to join their London business network.</description>

      <description>Recently I moaned about the state of comments and spam - and I hinted that comments would be enabled across my website again.
My interests in social media do extend to &amp;lsquo;the Facebook&amp;rsquo; - but my expertise is definitely not with that network. Given a limited number of hours in each day, I have enough social media stuff to do.
Facebook Comments Only a few months back, Facebook launched their own comments system allowing external websites an easy way to integrate with Facebooks own commenting system.</description>

      <description>Delicious, that’s delicious.com or del.icio.us for those old enough - has finally updated its Firefox extension - though it is still a beta version, the updated extension is available in the Mozilla Add-ons applet-store
If you gave up on Delicious for syncing bookmarks cause browsers added their own tools like Google Bookmarks or Firefox Sync then maybe this isn&amp;rsquo;t for you.
If you’re still in love with the idea of social bookmarking - tagging and sharing your bookmarks … then this is something for you.</description>

      <description>Delicious, that’s delicious.com or del.icio.us for those who can remember it - is one of the original web 2.0 social media services that specialised in social-bookmarking. We should learn to love Delicious again now that they’ve got new owners.
Delicious is the original web 2.0 service we still love A few years back when something called web 2.0 was really a fluffy concept, Del.icio.us was the easy to understand social-bookmarking website.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not one to always login to Facebook … It&amp;rsquo;s a good week if I don&amp;rsquo;t log in at all. But for about 500 million people Facebook is pretty important.
As if Facebook really needed to tell you to bookmark their site if you already go there - but this bookmarket / on-site advertising is a fresh change to the usual page prompting you to login from your mobile.

      <description>Australians spend 1 in 5 minutes using social media sites. Social Networking usage was about 22% in December 2010 says comScore.
The statistics reveal that Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn are some of the most popular destinations. If you add into this instant messaging then the total rises to 35% - which is probably a more realistic definition of social networking.
There is a presentation you can download with really good insights on internet usage across Australia.</description>

      <description>LinkedInhas been the business social networkof choice for many and its nearly 10 years old, but younger upstarts have such a mass that its time to look at what LinkedIn can offer to social media marketing, especially for b2b marketing.
There is value in personally knowing your connection When LinkedIn first launched it was not much more than a way to list your work history and connect with business colleagues. It was even important that you had the email address of someone before you could add them – which meant at least you had their business card as people wouldn’t accept requests to connect if they couldn’t remember how they met you.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was Remembrance Sunday in the UK. For a lot of people its more significant than the 2 minute silence on 11 November because they are out doing things related to their cause - remembering the ones who have gone before us, visiting relatives that are veterans or just being the Carer to someone who was injured during service.
This made me think about how social media marketing can play a part in cause related marketing and what I would do to support my cause.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to copy here an opinion piecefrom the Guardian&amp;rsquo;s Comment is free section. It&amp;rsquo;s about a social media campaign related to the Twitter hashtag #ukuncuts which is impacting VodafoneUK — Vodafone has been facing protests &amp;amp; flashmobs in the past few weeks, something about 6 billion pounds and a few people think the UK Gov&amp;rsquo;t could do with the money.

This cool new feature can be found on the LinkedIn website- but you have to first change your own privacy settings from anonymous to share in the benefits of profile stats. I guess its the business persons equivalent of a Facebook poke or like.

When did you last stop to check that you were protected by your company social media policyor your employee policy allows you to access Facebook, YouTube or Twitter.

In Latvia, this week a Foursquare Swarm Badgeparty is being organised by a local mobile operator Bite Latvija.Latvia is fairly new to smart phones - but Twitter has been embraced by internet users - first for finding and following news stories and now Twitter is more popular than Facebook.

RJ Metrics monitors both services and predicts Gowalla&amp;rsquo;s user base will shortly make it to 350,000.Somewhere amongst the stats, you&amp;rsquo;ll see new users for Gowalla are growing around 2,000 per week but Foursquare recently peaked at 20,000 new users. Summer is usually quieter months for data revenue and usage (same for Jan &amp;amp; Feb Downunder), it will be interesting to track the user take up and usage to see if this is different.</description>

      <description>Foursquareand Gowallahave been grabbing the headlines and few companies are starting to monitor and track these services. RJ Metrics claims Foursquare will hit 2 million usersthis week.Somewhere amongst the stats, you&amp;rsquo;ll see new users for Foursquare are growing around 14,000 per week but recently peaked at 20,000 new users. This is probably due to active promotions such as being featured in Apple or Android TV adverts. August &amp;amp; September are usually quieter months for data revenue and usage thanks to Summer (same for Jan &amp;amp; Feb Downunder), it will be interesting to track the user take up and usage to see if this is different.</description>

      <description>Foursquare is still the UK&amp;rsquo;s most popular location based check-in game to play on your mobile. I&amp;rsquo;ve said it before that Foursquare would come out on tops over Gowalla and Brightkite.
These maps (thanks to Checkin Mania) indicate the difference in the number of locations that users have submitted to each service. The growth from crowd sourced locations and points of interest reflects in the growth of that services usage (ie the most popular service gets the most contributions from users) The point of reference is London Borough Market - one of the more famous places in London to visit.</description>

      <description>Foursquare can be loads of fun for the casual user and collecting badges can be just as fun as trying to be the local town mayor. Foursquare has still to come up with a good tool for events, but it does have the Swarm badge.
Get 50 of your best friends to checkin at the same location at the same time … and you&amp;rsquo;ll get the Swarm badge too.
Are you using Foursquare or Gowalla?</description>

      <description>Starting your plan for social media marketing in a small or big business should be driven by a need or a reason
Why use Social Media - because your customers are using it! First step in your social media marketing plan is to open powerpoint or write on a flipchart the reason why you need to use social media, some good reasons include:
 most of our target audience use social media (no brainer), or because visits to your brand or company website are down as our customers spend more time on social media sites (better) to deliver a sales &amp;amp; marketing programme using online &amp;amp; social media  There are probably plenty of other good reasons you can think of.</description>

      <description>Do you really need a Social Media Marketing Plan? And if your business needs a plan … why does it have to be social media?
Why Social Media Every business - big, small, startup or established brand needs to be using social media - yesterday. I was reading a flyer today which said &amp;lsquo;its critical for every website to include social media&amp;rsquo; — its not the website that needs it … its your marketing and sales plan!</description>

      <description>Social Media marketing - using Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Google+ … needs to form part of any marketing plan across the marketing mix. Treating Social Media as a separate activity from the rest of your marketing is a No-No … In fact social media should be integrated into every campaign or promotion.
Social Media marketing fits into new customer acquisition, customer retention, CRM, customer loyalty and anything else that customers do and thats true for D2C brands as well as B2B marketers.</description>

      <description>Foursquare is now open to business and is moving beyond geo-tagging and location based social networking. But is Foursquare really open to business? After trying to claim my business location and setup an offer for visitors its now been 3 weeks without a reply.
In the UK right now, I believe there is an opportunity for Gowalla, Foursquare, etc to setup a small but viable business team to work with digital agencies or mobile marketing specialists here.</description>
