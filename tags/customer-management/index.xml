      <description>I just started to use GoSquared this week – If you’ve got a high traffic website (well any website really) and want some real-time web analytics or insights – then you better get started with a FREE GoSquared account today. Using GoSquared I can watch as visitors come and go.
Free Web Analytics &amp;amp; insights  GoSquared monitors and analyses your website’s traffic in real-time – and you can watch all the action in the LiveStats console – which is like a 3 part Heads-Up Display.</description>
