      <description>I’ve been using Apple Macbook Pro as my primary work horse since 2008. I’ve always had ClamXav installed as a ‘heuristic’ solution to monitor apps and downloads for virus and malware.
I’m a fan of sandbox for apps, but as I do develop a whole heap of different things, just installing from the Mac App Store is not an option for me.
Now I’m going to look for other software ….</description>

      <description>If you wanted to know what I apps and software I use every day then here you go … For starters this is all Mac OSx stuff.
 AxureRP 6.5 – wireframes and interactive prototypes. UX/UI Heaven Terminal – go command line (for SSH and most server stuff like testing with siege) Coda 2 – An all in one IDE – FTP, MySQL database, CSS, Editor and more … Transmit – only if I can’t be bothered to use Coda Firefox (and then only for these 2 extensions) SQLite Manager – SQLite may be the new mySQL … we’ll see Selenium IDE – for browser based testing (but only in Firefox) Sequel Pro – mySQL database manager SourceTree (as it works with Bitbucket)  Other apps to know about  MarsEdit – Best blog tool around for WordPress – but definitely room to improve Scrivener – for writing all that blog stuff Omnigraffle – when you can’t use Axure (and don’t have Visio) Pixelmator – who needs Photoshop Aperture – who needs Lightroom Netnewswire – I do all my RSS reading on the mobile now  Cloud based stuff I use every day  Google.</description>

      <description>Sequel Prois the fastest and best MySQL client for Mac right now. After a mini disaster yesterday involving Sequel Pro and filename extensions, I thought I’d checkout the competition.
So I did a quick check and downloaded a few other apps that would manage MySQL on a Mac with OS x –
 MySQL Workbench RazorSQL (not free so didn’t try) Navicat  Both MySQL Workbench and Navicat are java based apps.</description>

      <description>I’ve been writing about Android for some time now. Here are 4 of the best Android apps for Wifi. These apps allow you to find public wi-fi networks, turn your phone into a wifi hotspot and a bit more.
HTC Wifi Hotspot This app can’t be downloaded from the market – its part of HTC build for Android 2.2 Froyo
I’ve used this loads of times – its great for getting my laptop or iPad on the Internet when needed, but the main point to remember is it kills your battery very fast.</description>

      <description>If you haven’t got an iPad or still not convinced you’ll need one – then you’re kidding yourself. As a marketing consultant new gadgets like the iPad need to be purchased, used extensively and then replaced with the next new shiny gadget. Why – you might ask? Because how else can you have an opinion or recommend a solution to your clients.
Today – I’m taking a quick look at the list of apps featured in iTunes under the category ‘business class’.</description>

      <description>I started the week with the ambition to just use iWork for a week. Today’s Tuesday and now I see the #failure of such a challenge.iWork Pages can’t convert Word documents so easily I’ve been sent a word document to review for a friend – that should be easy as iWork opens Microsoft Office Word .docx formats. The document opens ok … but the content has been placed into separate textblocks on the page just like any traditional desktop publishing app would do – but of course this was supposed to be a document that needed to be cleaned up.</description>

      <description>Managing wifi on your Android mobile phonecan be a hassle, so at least there are now 3 good apps for you to use to make your wifi experience better.
##Wifinder
Is the most technical looking of the 3 apps – turning it on was a bit of shock when compared to the user experience of the other 2 apps. WiFinder only has 1 button aptly labelled New Scan. You then press and hold on the WiFi SSID to see the more familar Android Wifi Connect.</description>

      <description>Developing for Android? You need to look to the bigger picture … actually this applies to anyone developing apps for mobile phones. If you want your app to be used by people that don’t speak English you need to translate it and provide some support.
There are going to be many opportunities for startups and anyone with a business model to go ‘international’ or expand abroad should check these points are covered in the marketing and product development plans.</description>

      <description>Develop apps for Android or develop mobile apps for Apple, some days its hard to figure out just what to do. On this website I’ve written a lot on Android phones and apps.Around 6000 apps have been removed from the Apple store recently due to their erotic nature. It’s not that Android Market has no quality control – Adult or Erotic does not exist as a content category in Android Market but dating apps or other soft-porn apps so far have not shown huge growth (ahem) on Android.</description>

      <description>So I have had to rebuild my Mac running OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard 3 times in the past 2 days after having problems with a t-mobile usb modem which corrupts the hard drive.Here’s the short list of my favourite, can’t live without em, just got to install them apps:
Best Apps for your Mac  ClamXav – still the best and most recommended free virus protection for your mac Adium – pronounced like stadium, this is the multi chat application for the mac Skype – for free calls to the office and home Dropbox – for sharing files between the office and clients Mac Office 2008 – word, powerpoint and to some extent excel, because all my templates are Office based and the guys in the office use PC’s.</description>

      <description>Should you be worried that you don’t have an iPhone app? Do you know if you’re website works on a mobile? what about mobile SEO? It is very important for CEO’s and CMO’s to add mobile to their communications and marketing strategy.
The fact that most companies have yet to build a mobile website shows you are not alone and many companies want to know what they should do first.</description>

      <description>With the boom in the number of apps in the App Store (over 100,000) and total downloads in excess of 2bn … someone has got to be making money … right?In part, the iPhone does offer a better platform for apps – it’s about to overtake RIM as the leading consumer smartphone, sold more than 34 million units and got some of the highest mobile internet usage rates we’ve seen so far.</description>

      <description>Now that you’ve ripped and digitised all of your CD library – what do you do with your CD’s? One idea is to create a catalogue and then you can box or put away (or recycle) your CD’s and DVD’s giving you much more space to fill with books, CD’s or other stuff.If you’re like me, I’ve been ripping all my CD’s for years and the CD and cases were just collecting dust in my room.</description>

      <description>So its Happy Birthday to Apple and its App Store – 1 year old. Its created a new industry and probably will change the way everyone digests content – now that everything has an app or a widget you dont need to browse for it.
Except for Search – Apple and the Apps store has changed how mobile phone manufacturers think about content like Nokia, RIM and Sony Ericsson all launched (or launching) app stores in the past 3 months.</description>
