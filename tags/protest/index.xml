      <description>Yesterday was Remembrance Sunday in the UK. For a lot of people its more significant than the 2 minute silence on 11 November because they are out doing things related to their cause â€“ remembering the ones who have gone before us, visiting relatives that are veterans or just being the Carer to someone who was injured during service.
This made me think about how social media marketing can play a part in cause related marketing and what I would do to support my cause.</description>
