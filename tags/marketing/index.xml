      <description>Digital marketing has its benefits mainly that it’s easy to launch a social media campaign without any prior relationship with the victim.
I’m more annoyed at the damage young companies do to their brand, reputation and domain-name … at wasted opportunities from legitimate startups who just spam any contacts in one e-mail blast.
Last week, I got an email sent to me with someone elses info - yet it was an invite to join their London business network.</description>

      <description>In Lithuania mobile penetration is almost at 150% - so is this all from younger people sim swapping?
Mobile Youth in Lithuania (16-24 yo) are all using multi-sims for the best deals and free calls. The 3 main operators are Omnitel, Bite and Tele2. Freedom of choice means that handsets are not subsidised very much and customers have to pay full price for a phone. Even the the &amp;lsquo;popular&amp;rsquo; iPhone is over priced and still exclusive with one operator and on a 24 month contract.</description>

      <description>In Lithuania the usage of the internet is reaching saturation point. A 2009 official report shows 95% of young people aged 16-24 with internet access**.**
Lithuania has one of the highest per capita access to broadband ratios due to small land mass and population of just under 4 million. It&amp;rsquo;s also atypical of &amp;lsquo;westernised&amp;rsquo; European markets and the Lithuanian youth are no different - wanting mobile phones, good clothes, good education and a future with a good job (most likely in London).</description>

Why Social Media Every business - big, small, startup or established brand needs to be using social media - yesterday.

      <description>Social Media marketing - using Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Google+ … needs to form part of any marketing plan across the marketing mix. Treating Social Media as a separate activity from the rest of your marketing is a No-No … In fact social media should be integrated into every campaign or promotion.
Social Media marketing fits into new customer acquisition, customer retention, CRM, customer loyalty and anything else that customers do and thats true for D2C brands as well as B2B marketers.</description>

      <description>You can try to avoid watching this advert all you want - but you just got to know what it is that Bill and Jerry cooked up here in the Shoe Circus - Windows Vista advert
.
Really does the ad say much - No … Does it try to convince you to switch - No … but maybe its a brand ad and not a product ad
Lots of talk of quality, runs tight, last, endurance and other words in the ad - so maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll see them more in the &amp;lsquo;product ads&amp;rsquo; when they come out?</description>
