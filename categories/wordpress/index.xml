      <description>WordPress 3.5.2 is here … and it’s not to be confused with the 3.6 beta releases. Being a point release, you shouldn’t expect significant changes. WordPress 3.5.2 is a security release, which means it’s critical that you update your site.
What’s in WordPress 3.5.2? The release note for this specifically looks to address a bunch of security related issues:
 Blocking server-side request forgery attacks, which could potentially enable an attacker to gain access to a site.</description>

      <description>WordPress is under going an attack by a swarm of Zombies– and they are after any site with an Admin user account. Securing WordPress is easy and you can do two things to protect your website and yourself.
  Change and then delete your Admin account (if you haven’t already)
  Only allow access to WordPress /wp-admin by your IP address
  Of course, you should also have a backup strategy — and so why not setup my plugin DBC Backup 2 to do the hard work.</description>

      <title>Differences between a plugin and a theme</title>

      <description>In WordPress, as with many things, there are two ways to add features and customise your website, either with themes (php template files) or plugins. There are multiple threads about what’s the difference between a theme and a plugin. A plugin ‘should not’ change your website design / look and feel … But a theme can do everything a plugin does (including installing other plugins). Difference between a plugin and a theme To make things sound simple … Primarily, a plugin gives you the user, fine control via the shortcode as to when my plugin function is activated, and of course you can just turn off the plugin at any time.</description>

      <description>In WordPress, images are automatically re-saved in different sizes like creating a thumbnail. But what happens if you want to use your own image? or want a different size?
Note: each image will also get a custom class added called dsimage … this means you can style it.</description>

      <description>I’ve been using MarsEdit for years and really like its features … recently I reformatted my Mac and now find that all my WordPress posts are being published immediately. Even after I set the date for ‘tomorrow’ for example.
By the way .. I’d love it if MarsEdit would add a text editor toolbar to make it easier to apply formatting styles like lists, headers or font styles.
 Small Bug – Set post date gets overwritten when you change post status I was getting annoyed and found that if I set the blog post date to ‘tomorrow’, then set the post status to published .</description>

      <title>Why I use WordPress?</title>

      <guid>http://damien.co/blog/2013-03-06-why-i-use-wordpress/</guid>
      <description>Why use WordPress and Compare WordPress features sound like pretty SEO friendly keywords. Right? And if you’re new to WordPress, you’ll probably see many articles focus on three words – Free, Simple &amp;amp; Easy. These words tell you nothing about WordPress and so this is to help you decide to choose WordPress.
I started using WordPress in 2003 and I still have my hosted account London.WordPress.com. I switched to standalone or self-hosted in 2009 and from 2010, I’ve been running WordPress network or WordPress multisite.</description>

      <description>I’m not trying to torture myself — which is why for the past 18 months managing my plugins in the WordPress SVN repository has been separated from my development work which is all saved in Git (Bitbucket to be totally honest).
The time has come to find out just what ‘git svn‘ is all about and see if I can make it work! I’ve yet to become a master or ninja of Git .</description>

      <title>HOW TO: Stop (most) Automated Comment Spam</title>

      <description>It is easy to stop most WordPress comment spam instantly with one small change to your theme’s functions.php. This is one of my favourite WordPress functions and I use it on all my setups.
This code snippet works by blocking comments from being added offsite or indirectly and not from the comment box on your webpage. Most spammers try to automate their ‘workload’ and try to exploit WordPress functions that allow you to manage comments or add posts via the WordPress API’s.</description>

What are your choices to mobilise a WordPress Website? You have 4 choices

Most of the available options are just plugins, a quick scan of the WordPress plugin repo will show there are plenty of options from donation buttons for PayPal to integrations with Magento.

      <title>Pros and Cons of Post Formats vs. WordPress Multisite</title>

      <description>WordPress is a flexible solution for web publishing. Post Formats were introduced a couple of years back to help users and developers to create content in one WYSIWYG Editorbut show it differently on the site. I’ll start by saying that there is quite a bit of press about why there is a general lack of support by theme developers for post formats(see one example below).
– If you have a theme which doesn’t support post formats (most don’t) then you can’t start this way.</description>

      <description>WordPress gets a major update about twice a year. If you’re responsible for doing the upgrade here’s a pre-update checklist for WordPress to help you identify any bugs that will get in the way of a flawless update.
The main point of the checklist is to reduce risk of failure by helping you identifying potential issues and roadblocks and give you confidence in a fast update process.
A second point to remember is the cost of not running the update – staying on an older version of WordPress can expose you to security issues which are fixed in the new update and also make it harder at a later time to run an update.</description>

      <description>If you’re into WordPress Security (which you should be) … then you’ve probably already played around with your .htaccess file to block comment spam. For a number of years now, Perishable Press has been working on a blacklist to help kills spam and other un-welcomes! Now in its 5th Generation the Blacklist is very powerful.
Perishable Press is a great source of information on .htaccess and URL rewrite rules … but I wanted to just highlight a couple of things (perhaps for my own memory).</description>

      <description>When ever there is a security updatefor WordPress you should always update your blog and website as soon as possible. According to Kasperskyone of the reasons that the recent Flashback Mac OSx Trojan malware infected 600,000+ computers was due to infected WordPress websites.
So how did this happen? When developers build you a website there typically is no time or budget left over for maintenance and updates. This means websites can be left running on old versions of WordPress with known security issues and these can be exploited by hackers.</description>

      <description>The title field and the big Post Editing Area are fixed in place, but you can reposition all the other boxes using drag and drop, and can minimize or expand them by clicking the title bar of each box.
Use the Screen Options tab to unhide more boxes (Excerpt, Send Trackbacks, Custom Fields, Discussion, Slug, Author) or to choose a 1- or 2-column layout for this screen.</description>

      <description>No – font’s are not locked in WordPress, but it’s easy to switch to the HTML Editor – where cut paste will only paste plain text.
Alternatively, If you’re in the Visual Editor then … Click the W icon and paste there first.
tip: You can also switch to the HTML Editor to check if there is formatting you don’t want</description>

      <description>WordPress offers lots of plugins to choose from and if you add to many you will soon come across this Fatal Error message. You can easily fix the problem (and then go back to adding more plugins).
This out of memory error doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you have to go buy more RAM — just have to amend a line of text in a wordpress settings file.
 Fix the Fatal Error: Allowed Memory Size When you installed WordPress you either uploaded it using FTP yourself or went to an admin cpanel and installed it.</description>

      <description>I’ve been using EvoHostingfor a good couple of years now and have always been impressed by their service and flexibility. I’ve felt my site has suffered in recent months – I just feel the performance has suffered and have few options to speed-up my website.

      <description>[WordPress] is a great tool. It has its own way of managing updates to your website – and will switch to maintenance mode automatically. Sometimes this is called an HTTP Status 503 Service Unavailable.
For the best user experience you can setup your own custom maintenance page – where you can show your brand, making it clear that this is planned maintenance and give your visitor some where else to go.</description>

What people don’t know is that WordPress self hosted is the best solution for building a standalone B2B or SME company website. We recently finished the migration of the mmCHANNEL company website from an in-house developed website (using PHP, etc) to single install, self hosted WordPress installation.
There were a few times when I felt that maybe WordPress wasn’t right, but overall it’s going great and the results are visible!</description>

      <description>The second release candidate for the next version of WordPress 3.2 is here. If you haven’t started testing 3.2, now is the time. Previous experience would make this the final RC before the real deal.
 Should I update to this release candidate? As this is a release candidate you shouldn’t use this on a really important live site – but it does mean it’s pretty stable and useful. You should find that most popular plugins and themes have no issues as developers have been working since RC1.</description>

      <description>If you’re reading and researching Why WordPress – you’ll probably see many articles focus on three words – Free, Simple &amp;amp; Easy. These words tell you nothing about WordPress and so I started writing this to help you decide to choose WordPress.
I started using WordPress in 2003 and I still have my hosted account London.WordPress.com. I switched to self-hosted in 2009.
For me, I’ve chosen WordPress because
 WordPress is something I use everyday I recommend WordPress to clients and friends WordPress integrates in a social media marketing strategy WordPress can morph from a blog to a website or a CMS Getting started is hassle-free   WordPress is right to use everydayWordPress, it’s mobile app, plugins and 3rdparty tools are improving – this makes WordPress something I enjoy using every day.</description>

 What’s in this release?There isn’t much from a user or admin perspective, but you don’t normally expect that in a point release. If you do a lot of WordPress support or development changes to the import process and media file management maybe of interest.</description>

      <title>HOW TO: Enable WordPress maintenance mode</title>

      <description>WordPress is a great tool. It has its own way of managing updates to your website – and will switch to maintenance mode automatically. For the best user experience you should enable maintenance mode yourself.
How to Enable Maintenance Mode without a Plugin – method 1 Activating maintenance mode without a plugin is easy. First, open your FTP program and then navigate to the root folder of you WordPress install.</description>

      <guid>http://damien.co/wordpress/switching-to-scrivener-for-wordpress-blogging-2901/</guid>
      <description>I’ve just made the switch – or as we speak, I’m starting to learn about this ‘new’ tool for writers called Scrivener. Described as the app for writers, journalists and anyone that needs to write short or long stories, Scrivener collects together scraps of articles, research material and helps to draft your writing.
To me, the biggest problem with regular blogging is the interface. If you blog on the go then you already know that the WordPress admin suite is not very accessible when you’re in a plane, train or automobile.</description>

This was the first update in nearly 6 months so it was a surprise that barely a week later we get another update.

      <description>Some days I think a spring cleanis just as good for you as taking a holiday. Out with the old and give yourself some more space to create a mess.
Take for example this website – its built using WordPress and being very critical about the quality of my work or ‘portfolio’, I always want to be tweaking and changing my website and lookg at ways to make things better. So thankfully, today Woothemes(who I use with all my projects) came out with a new magazine layout that I’ve installed already.</description>

      <description>WordPress is one of the best end to end solutions for building a website and it has a large selection of themes, plugins and tools to make it more than just another blog. I recommend WordPress at the start of any project – just because it typically requires less management involvement or decisions from the IT or Tech teams to get started with.Having spent a lot more time writing about Social Media lately, I wanted to collect these posts into an editable collection (maybe I should have started by writing all my posts in word you might say).</description>

This out of memory error doesn’t mean you have to go buy more RAM — just have to amend a line of text in a wordpress settings file.
