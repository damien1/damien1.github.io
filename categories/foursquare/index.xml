      <description>Mayor-ry New Year Foursquare friends and fans. I just gave up my 30 odd Mayorships because its more fun watching other people become Mayor and because I saw that longtime users (including me) are guilty of using Foursquare so much that newer users are stopped from getting to be Mayor.
So now that I have no Mayor-ships does that mean I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in Foursquare? — No way, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to watch more venues and continue to monitor its growth.</description>

      <description>Most of Europeans don&amp;rsquo;t understand Halloween and joke about the idea of going out to trick or treat. But at least your average Foursquare user can share in the Halloween spirit even if no one else does.
In order to score Halloween 2010 badge (above, at right), simply check in anytime this weekend, anywhere on Foursquare, but make sure to shout “Happy Halloween!” when you do.</description>
