      <description>WordPress offers lots of plugins to choose from and if you add to many you will soon come across this Fatal Error message. You can easily fix the problem (and then go back to adding more plugins).
This out of memory error doesn’t mean you have to go buy more RAM — just have to amend a line of text in a wordpress settings file.
 Fix the Fatal Error: Allowed Memory Size When you installed WordPress you either uploaded it using FTP yourself or went to an admin cpanel and installed it.</description>

So sometimes you want more freedom to control your server (like Rackspace), but using a shared server gives you few choices to do this. Here is the solution for WordPress sites hosted by EvoHosting UK which you can implement now.</description>
