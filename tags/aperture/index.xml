      <description>Apple has updated its Aperture software to 3.1.2 – it seems to focus on the new users who quite likely brought the Appstore copy.
The release note is not very useful – but maybe the adjustments will be interesting to see what happens.

      <description>I’ve been using Apple Aperture 3 for my digital photography and image processing for a couple of years. It’s great for importing those images for clients and quickly doing all the editing, tagging, grouping and touch-ups.
What I didn’t like about it as a workflow tool – is that it lacks proper integration with Flickr. In the 3.0 version from last year you could publish as a Set of photos to Flickr, but couldn’t just add an image to your photostream.</description>
