      <description>Here I am … I’m messing with your head. I wanted to see how easy it is to get my Isotope Visual Layouts plugin for WordPress to change your your homepage. Actually it was too easy and the result is destruction and chaos.
No-No – I’m Never Going to Mess with your Head First thing to note – Never do anything with a plugin that ‘you’ the User doesn’t expect. That’s bad bad karma.</description>

      <description>Isotope Visual Layouts Pro is getting an update … and it’s one that a few of you have been asking for.
Isotope Visual Layouts Pro 1.9 is currently in testing and it will include a shortcode for Infinite Scroll.
I’m also making it safe to use on any page or post so you can really have different layouts (like one with infinite scroll and one with filtrify)
This will be the ‘last’ update for Isotope Visual Layouts Pro … I’m working on something hotter with sorting and drag n drop.</description>

      <description>Welcome and say hello to empty. empty is a bunch of ANT Build Tasks for WordPress plugin developers that help automate the build thanks to Apache Ant.
Why ANT not PHING? Go ask Google that … there are plenty of conversations elsewhere on ANT vs PHING. It’s really a personal choice.
Ant, Phing, Grunt.js, make are all build tools for developers. Ant is a popular tool, free and widely used. It’s commonly used for Java but can fit in with other code and projects.</description>

      <description>Enabling and Disabling Jetpack for WordPress individual plugins presented a bit of a challenge recently. Not having used Jetpack before, I thought it time to try out this collection of plugins developed and maintained by Automattic over the past 4 weeks.
I’ve discovered that Jetpack is a feature rich collection of plugins but I seriously doubled-up on plugins doing the same job. I didn’t need Google Analytics as well as WordPress Stats.</description>

So when I do develop, I want a trusted, reliable, repeatable workflow setup that is always testing, always building and always telling me whats going on. That’s why I believe in Continuous Integration … and why I’ve turned to Jenkins as my CI Tool and use Apache Ant and Selenium for testing.</description>

      <description>Isotope Visual Layouts Pro WordPress plugin is easier to use now that it’s using the Twitter Bootstrap framework with great CSS options and features.
Damien’s WordPress plugins have great features that mean you can improve your website and not change your theme. This is ideal for a designer or developer who wants to change the look n feel via custom CSS. Overtime, I’ve come to realise that most people download or buy the plugin on the basis off the look.</description>

      <description>Isotope Visual Layouts Pro pluginintroduces a click to enlarge feature for box items that are part of the grid layout. This uses a cool jQuery element that changes the CSS class and refreshes the layout of the page.
Checkout the demoand click on each box / image.
It took me a bit to learn how to do this – only cause I’m not a frontend developer. But if you’d like to add toggleClass to your Isotope WordPress project, then you might like this.</description>

      <title>Visual Layouts for WordPress turns Pro and gets Twitter Bootstrap</title>

      <description>Visual Layouts is the alternative, responsive, animated, grid layout WordPress plugin. It’s similar to adding isotope and masonry jQuery. Visual Layouts for WordPress is another way that you can change your website without changing your theme.
Now Visual Layouts is turning Pro and the first feature I’ll show off is integration with Twitter Bootstrap CSS.
I think that Twitter Bootstrapis an awesome solution for anyone wanting to use good web design concepts – of course, the internet might be pretty ‘bland’ if we all used this framework.</description>

Using two of my plugins, you can create a visual grid of your posts, photos, portfolio, products and even use it to create your own WooCommerce e-commerce product page without having to get a new theme.</description>

      <description>So I noticed recently that Google has an index of everyone who has installed my plugin but hasn’t locked down their website. Which led me to wonder ‘If I could find these insecure sites via Google, should I warn them?’.
And so I did …
 I’m a WordPress developer in the UK and I look after a plugin called DBC-Backup-2.
I’ve always loved DBC-Backup ( a plugin you are are using on your website ), so when I found out that no one was maintaining it, I decided to ‘adopt’ DBC-Backup.</description>

      <description>WordPress is one of the most flexible web apps to customise for your needs. Creating custom post types in WordPress is also quite easy and Pods Framework looks like a plugin that will make it easier still.
I’m going to give it a try!</description>

      <description>A new version of DBC Backup 2 has been released. I’m doing this to make life just a little bit harder. You should update to v2.1.1 as soon as possible please.

      <description>“WP to Buffer is a plugin for WordPress that sends updates to your Buffer (bufferapp.com) account for scheduled publishing to social networks when you publish and/or update WordPress Pages, Posts and/or Custom Post Types.”
— Now I like Buffer a lot … I use it mostly via Twitter to ‘Buffer’ my tweets at different times of the day.
If you don’t already have a plugin to send your scheduled posts to Twitter then here’s a plugin to try that will send them to your Buffer queue.</description>

      <description>Isotope Visual Layouts my plugin for WordPress will soon be updated to version 1. This is a big milestone for me and from my perspective, the plugin will be ‘out of beta’.
I think, I have been talking about this for some time … but it’s been a bit harder for me to finish as I started a new job and need to commute out of London every day. I have also been working on another plugin and wanted to re-use what I have learnt / built from that project.</description>

      <description>Isotope Visual Post Layouts for WordPress has just been updated. As the plugin is no-longer in the WordPress repo (it’s not GPL compliant) … you’ll need to download this plugin and install it manually.
 Whats new in v0.33? In advance of further development, I decided it was best to introduce update notifications so that ‘you’ can be alerted to any new updates.
What this means is your WordPress dashboard will in future let you know of future releases.</description>

You can create a visual post layout in a post, a page, in fact … almost anywhere 🙂

      <description>Today I’ve been reading up on Freetilea jQuery project by Yannisfor visual layouts similar to what I’ve done with Isotope Visual Post Layouts.
 Freetile is a plugin for jQuery that enables the organization of webpage content in an efficient, dynamic and responsive layout. It can be applied to a container element and it will attempt to arrange it’s children in a layout that makes optimal use of screen space, by “packing” them in a tight arrangement.</description>
