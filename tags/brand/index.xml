      <description>Digital marketing has its benefits mainly that it’s easy to launch a social media campaign without any prior relationship with the victim.
I’m more annoyed at the damage young companies do to their brand, reputation and domain-name … at wasted opportunities from legitimate startups who just spam any contacts in one e-mail blast.
Last week, I got an email sent to me with someone elses info – yet it was an invite to join their London business network.</description>

      <description>You can try to avoid watching this advert all you want – but you just got to know what it is that Bill and Jerry cooked up here in the Shoe Circus – Windows Vista advert
.
Really does the ad say much – No … Does it try to convince you to switch – No … but maybe its a brand ad and not a product ad
Lots of talk of quality, runs tight, last, endurance and other words in the ad – so maybe you’ll see them more in the ‘product ads’ when they come out?</description>
