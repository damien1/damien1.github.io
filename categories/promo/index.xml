      <description>Merry Christmas … I found this quote recently and I think it&amp;rsquo;s quite funny and timely
Christmas is a time when kids tell Santa what they want and adults pay for it. Deficits are when adults tell the government what they want and their kids pay for it.  ~Richard Lamm
I hope you&amp;rsquo;re having a great day! wherever you are in the world - make the most of it.</description>
