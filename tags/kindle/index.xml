      <description>I’ve decided that designers and creative types like to bundle mobile apps with features that can be near impossible to bring to life. I know I’m going to lose a few ‘friends’ here .. but bare with me a minute.
When developing your first app for your brand or client – it’s more important to engage customers and get usage through having the right features and a flawless function.
Mobile Apps need to be beautiful in form &amp;amp; flawless in function Would you rather an app that is a ‘Thing of Beauty’ or an App that delivers on its function?</description>
