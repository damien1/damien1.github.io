      <description>Social Media Marketing is a growing body of knowledge and everything about ‘it’ is in a state of flux and changing rapidly, It’s unfair to call anything a bible. I doubt this book will be around in 2000 years – and it’s twice as fat as any bible you might see today.
Admirably, I agree with the authors intention – to collect a lot of (good) writing in one place … but the material in this book has aged already and which means the book is only worth it at a discounted rate or for anyone starting out with their own website or social media novice.</description>

      <description>I’ve had a look at the Sony Ericsson new Walkman W902 with retro chunky buttons much like a those on a casette walkman.
The phone’s not retro though – Clear Crystal Audio for your listening pleasure and a 5.0 mega pixel camera is a great feature. I think its also got a really good speaker to annoy Grannies on the bus with.
I hope it comes out with more than a 1Gb of memory!</description>
