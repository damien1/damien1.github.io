In Latvia, this week a Foursquare Swarm Badgeparty is being organised by a local mobile operator Bite Latvija.Latvia is fairly new to smart phones – but Twitter has been embraced by internet users – first for finding and following news stories and now Twitter is more popular than Facebook. So it must be possible to get 50 people in a room with a joint interest in new technology and mobile phones.</description>
