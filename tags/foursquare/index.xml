      <description>Mayor-ry New Year Foursquare friends and fans. I just gave up my 30 odd Mayorships because its more fun watching other people become Mayor and because I saw that longtime users (including me) are guilty of using Foursquare so much that newer users are stopped from getting to be Mayor.
So now that I have no Mayor-ships does that mean I’m not interested in Foursquare? — No way, but I’m going to watch more venues and continue to monitor its growth.</description>

      <description>Eastern Europe might not be where you would expect to find social media marketing being trialled ‘so soon’. In Latvia, this week a Foursquare Swarm Badgeparty is being organised by a local mobile operator Bite Latvija.Latvia is fairly new to smart phones – but Twitter has been embraced by internet users – first for finding and following news stories and now Twitter is more popular than Facebook. So it must be possible to get 50 people in a room with a joint interest in new technology and mobile phones.</description>

Recently it changed the rules to the most checkins in the past 60 days .. and now it has changed to only 1 checkin is valid each day.</description>

      <description>Foursquareand Gowallahave been grabbing the headlines and few companies are starting to monitor and track these services. RJ Metrics claims Foursquare will hit 2 million usersthis week.Somewhere amongst the stats, you’ll see new users for Foursquare are growing around 14,000 per week but recently peaked at 20,000 new users. This is probably due to active promotions such as being featured in Apple or Android TV adverts. August &amp;amp; September are usually quieter months for data revenue and usage thanks to Summer (same for Jan &amp;amp; Feb Downunder), it will be interesting to track the user take up and usage to see if this is different.</description>

      <title>Foursquare most popular location checkin game in London</title>

      <description>Foursquare is still the UK’s most popular location based check-in game to play on your mobile. I’ve said it before that Foursquare would come out on tops over Gowalla and Brightkite.
These maps (thanks to Checkin Mania) indicate the difference in the number of locations that users have submitted to each service. The growth from crowd sourced locations and points of interest reflects in the growth of that services usage (ie the most popular service gets the most contributions from users) The point of reference is London Borough Market – one of the more famous places in London to visit.</description>

      <description>Looking for some help with your Foursquare and Social Media Marketing? Then look no further than the badges of the people who you work with. Damien Saunders has been working hard to collect badges, pins, mayorships to be able to provide the best insights and metrics for the location based checkin mobile games.
The game inside Foursquare has two parts:
 Any user can become a Mayor when they check-in the most to a particular venue, Users get badges for activities like going to a 5 different coffee shops.</description>

      <description>Foursquare can be loads of fun for the casual user and collecting badges can be just as fun as trying to be the local town mayor. Foursquare has still to come up with a good tool for events, but it does have the Swarm badge.
Get 50 of your best friends to checkin at the same location at the same time … and you’ll get the Swarm badge too.
Are you using Foursquare or Gowalla?</description>

      <title>Gowalla? Foursquare open for Business? Who will setup a business team in Europe First</title>

      <description>Foursquare is now open to business and is moving beyond geo-tagging and location based social networking. But is Foursquare really open to business? After trying to claim my business location and setup an offer for visitors its now been 3 weeks without a reply.
In the UK right now, I believe there is an opportunity for Gowalla, Foursquare, etc to setup a small but viable business team to work with digital agencies or mobile marketing specialists here.</description>
