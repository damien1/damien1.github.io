      <description>WordPressis one of the most popular solutions for blogging. What people don&amp;rsquo;t know is that WordPress self hosted is the best solution for building a standalone B2B or SME company website. We recently finished the migration of the mmCHANNEL company website from an in-house developed website (using PHP, etc) to single install, self hosted WordPress installation.
There were a few times when I felt that maybe WordPress wasn&amp;rsquo;t right, but overall it&amp;rsquo;s going great and the results are visible!</description>

      <description>So I got my copy of the new ****The Smashing Book 2. Smashing Magazine is for anyone into design, web development and new media. It is one of many websites I follow on a weekly basis.
 The book came nicely (over) packaged and was immediately opened. It is a resource in itself and provides 10+ essays on topics from mobile app design to self-publishing - all new and not available on the website.</description>
