      <description>LinkedInhas changed its settings so that basic or free users can now find out who actually looked at their profile in the last week. This cool new feature can be found on the LinkedIn website– but you have to first change your own privacy settings from anonymous to share in the benefits of profile stats. I guess its the business persons equivalent of a Facebook poke or like.
Check it out … and while you’re at it – add me as a colleague on LinkedIn</description>
