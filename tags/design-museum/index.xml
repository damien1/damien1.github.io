      <description>I’m a member of the Design Museum here in Londonand so it was nice to see they have a free app with collection of the best pieces. It does remind me of the Phaidon Design Classics book-as-an-app (which still has not been changed since the first iPad).
I like this application and I was researching text overflow and scrolling. Since iPad no longer shows scrollbars then it’s up to the user to figure what is scrolling or not.</description>
