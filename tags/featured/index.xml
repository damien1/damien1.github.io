      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just made the switch - or as we speak, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to learn about this &amp;lsquo;new&amp;rsquo; tool for writers called Scrivener. Described as the app for writers, journalists and anyone that needs to write short or long stories, Scrivener collects together scraps of articles, research material and helps to draft your writing.

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;m a certified Scrum Master and very good at project and task management I can say I enjoy running planning sessions with teams I do work with. Now I&amp;rsquo;ve started to discover the freedom of the Post-It Note for planning and brainstorming.

Even better, its essential for any startup to be able to focus on what has to be done and avoid distractions like outsiders wanting extra work or changes to scope.</description>

      <description>Are Twitter Followers better than Facebook Fanswas a topic discussed on emarketer recently. It&amp;rsquo;s a question I get asked all the time - relatively speaking - Which is the best social network to start social media marketing?
