      <title>Switching to Scrivener for WordPress blogging</title>

      <description>I’ve just made the switch – or as we speak, I’m starting to learn about this ‘new’ tool for writers called Scrivener. Described as the app for writers, journalists and anyone that needs to write short or long stories, Scrivener collects together scraps of articles, research material and helps to draft your writing.
To me, the biggest problem with regular blogging is the interface. If you blog on the go then you already know that the WordPress admin suite is not very accessible when you’re in a plane, train or automobile.</description>

      <description>As more people become aware of HTML5 it’s time to review how tagging written content will impact search engine optimisation. Tags like and are redundant – instead and have been in use for a few years by many blogging and web developer tools. Now the HTML5 standard recognises that and should only be used for visual style.

      <description>Initially I was dubious or even skeptical about the new Apple Mac App Store – and everyone from Mashableto ReadWriteWebto Download Squadhave already done a post about first thoughts or white washed the Apple PR news item.
Things that are surprising in the Mac App Store I was surprised to find this week that Mobile App Developers are using this as the opportunity to port their Apps off of the phone to the desktop.</description>

      <description>Foursquare this week should break through the 5 million users mark and it has taken about 8 weeks to add an extra million. While Foursquare is still the most popular of the location based social networks (anyone using SCVNGR??) other services are making a better play at location marketing.Slow down in the rate of new users The latest RJ Metrics graphic for Foursquare convincingly shows the decline in the week on week growth of new users.</description>

      <title>Have you tried LinkedIn lately?</title>

      <description>LinkedInhas been the business social networkof choice for many and its nearly 10 years old, but younger upstarts have such a mass that its time to look at what LinkedIn can offer to social media marketing, especially for b2b marketing.
There is value in personally knowing your connection When LinkedIn first launched it was not much more than a way to list your work history and connect with business colleagues. It was even important that you had the email address of someone before you could add them – which meant at least you had their business card as people wouldn’t accept requests to connect if they couldn’t remember how they met you.</description>
