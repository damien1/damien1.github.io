      <description>Comment: Internet traffic to the iPlayer site is growing rapidly supported by outside advertising posterboards as well as reminders during TV advertising. However a lot of internet traffic seems to be sucked up by their kservices P2P network which aims to share the downloaded files with other iPlayer users.
 UK Internet traffic to the BBCâ€™s iPlayer website increased 14-fold between the week ending 8 December 2007 and the week ending 5 January.</description>
