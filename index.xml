      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fan of Marcel Proust and the madeleine in lime blossom tea for some time. When you first think of reading Proust, it can be daunting - 7 books, 4000+ pages and some incredibly dense text. But I did it, and love it.
It&amp;rsquo;s been over 10 years since I first read In Search of Lost Time &amp;hellip; so it was time to pick up the books again.</description>

      <description>Welcome &amp;hellip; and say Hello to Hugo.
I&amp;rsquo;m sorry to say my love affair with WordPress is at an end. I moved on, and over the last few years, found maintaining my old site painful. It was time to move.
It&amp;rsquo;s not all WordPress fault - I&amp;rsquo;ve had continue problems of short outages after my web host was bought out by another company. After migrating to a new server, I lost all my sub-domains so WordPress Multisite was of no use.</description>

      <description>Hi there. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s been awhile, but I&amp;rsquo;m back and just trying to figure out what I will do with this site.
In the meantime, social media and digital marketing has moved on; so most of my content is on Instagram. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me started about Twitter. Do people still use it? or just bots?</description>

      <description>Internet Explorer 11 recently started to crash every time I visited my SharePoint 2013 site and a SharePoint 2010 site.
I had recently updated Internet Explorer, Office and Lync communicator. I was pretty sure the error was with one of these updates.
The error is Internet Explorer has stopped working you can close the error and the page tries to reload, but will crash again,
I re-ran the Office Updater (Go to Control Panel &amp;gt; Add / Remove Programmes) and selected repair.</description>

      <description>The one SharePoint 2013 page I always want to get to easily is the Site Settings. The URL looks something like this is
http://&amp;lt;site&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;sitecollection&amp;gt;_/_layouts/15/settings.aspx
The problem is that it is a mouthful to remember so I&amp;rsquo;m going to use AutoHotKey to remember this for me.</description>

      <description>Trello is one of my favourite tools for project planning and also time wasting - I guess you can spend hours planning your life (ha ha).
I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a sample board for anyone wanting to use Trello to help manage their house purchase. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty specific for 1st time buyers / renters but you can adapt it.</description>

      <description>Well it’s happened – I seem to be hitting memory issues as a result of running too many WordPress sites on a shared hosting plan.
As a start to addressing this – I’m consolidating my sites and _may_ turn off WordPress multisite. I don’t really need it though it makes things easier to update one site rather than doing them one at a time.</description>

      <description>DBC Backup 2 has just undergone a major update to use mysqli connector. This is a significant change as the PHP mysql connector has been flagged for removal since PHP v5.
For the first time the plugin will introduce a download function - allow a logged in admin user to download the backup file.
The new version is slated for release in the next week and is currently in stability testing.</description>

      <description>I’ve brought a brand new Asus RT-AC66U modem/router and decided that to use my old Netgear N600 ADSL modem/router DGND3700v1 to extend my home network and expand my wireless network.
I’ve put the Netgear in a room where there was poor wifi signal strength and used a powerline (ethernet over power) adapter to connect back to the new main connection.
To get the Netgear to behave like a wireless Access Point and extend my existing network should have been easy.</description>

No-No – I’m Never Going to Mess with your Head First thing to note – Never do anything with a plugin that ‘you’ the User doesn’t expect. That’s bad bad karma.</description>

      <description>For the past month (2 or 3 months??) I’ve been more than quiet – I’ve really not been around. So this is just me saying ‘Hello World’ again.
Actually it’s been a crazy time – I’ve spent 6 weeks working in Maastricht in the Netherlands (or Holland if you don’t know better) which was an eye opener of an IT programme. And then … I moved house.
Finally, I changed to working on the deployment of another CRM system for MVNO’s.</description>

      <description>Isotope Visual Layouts Pro is getting an update … and it’s one that a few of you have been asking for.
Isotope Visual Layouts Pro 1.9 is currently in testing and it will include a shortcode for Infinite Scroll.
I’m also making it safe to use on any page or post so you can really have different layouts (like one with infinite scroll and one with filtrify)
This will be the ‘last’ update for Isotope Visual Layouts Pro … I’m working on something hotter with sorting and drag n drop.</description>

      <description>WordPress 3.5.2 is here … and it’s not to be confused with the 3.6 beta releases. Being a point release, you shouldn’t expect significant changes. WordPress 3.5.2 is a security release, which means it’s critical that you update your site.
What’s in WordPress 3.5.2? The release note for this specifically looks to address a bunch of security related issues:
 Blocking server-side request forgery attacks, which could potentially enable an attacker to gain access to a site.</description>

      <description>You may not have noticed, but I have … I’ve been quiet, and not been adding any new posts or updates to any of my WordPress plugin. I’ve also been busy and there are never enough hours in the day. I want to set out some thoughts on how a content strategy might help or detract.
Google Analytics One interesting Google Analytics trend that pops up when I look at my stats over a long period (try 3 years) is that these busy peaks (at work) also correlate with the downward slumps in visitor numbers.</description>

I only wore jeans, I’d always wear a long sleeve dress shirt and was starting to realise that a black dress shirt is amazing. I’d keep my eyes on the fashion rags and was always looking for another cool pair of jeans.</description>

Why ANT not PHING? Go ask Google that … there are plenty of conversations elsewhere on ANT vs PHING. It’s really a personal choice.
Ant, Phing, Grunt.js, make are all build tools for developers. Ant is a popular tool, free and widely used. It’s commonly used for Java but can fit in with other code and projects.</description>

I want to show you that it is easy to get started with WordPress Multisite in fact you can have your network of WordPress sites up in under 5 minutes (supposing you already have WordPress installed).</description>

      <description>MAMP (Mac, Apache, MySQL, PHP) is the first go to solution for anyone developing anything web based on your Mac. Even more so as Apple removed the easy controls to enable ‘web sharing‘ as it was called in 10.8 Mountain Lion. I had wanted to use WP-CLI – which is a set command line tools for WordPress, only that they don’t install / like MAMP. Which means, now is the time to replace MAMP with my own stack.</description>

  Change and then delete your Admin account (if you haven’t already)
  Only allow access to WordPress /wp-admin by your IP address
  Of course, you should also have a backup strategy — and so why not setup my plugin DBC Backup 2 to do the hard work.</description>

      <description>In WordPress, as with many things, there are two ways to add features and customise your website, either with themes (php template files) or plugins. There are multiple threads about what’s the difference between a theme and a plugin. A plugin ‘should not’ change your website design / look and feel … But a theme can do everything a plugin does (including installing other plugins). Difference between a plugin and a theme To make things sound simple … Primarily, a plugin gives you the user, fine control via the shortcode as to when my plugin function is activated, and of course you can just turn off the plugin at any time.</description>

function dbc_isotope_shortcode_handler($atts)Under that you just need to change posts=20 to posts=-1

By the way .. I’d love it if MarsEdit would add a text editor toolbar to make it easier to apply formatting styles like lists, headers or font styles.
 Small Bug – Set post date gets overwritten when you change post status I was getting annoyed and found that if I set the blog post date to ‘tomorrow’, then set the post status to published .</description>

Right or Wrong … If you like the style of your theme, WordPress plugins are there to extend the function of your site. This means you don’t have to replace your existing theme just to get a new feature.
 Want to get a cool theme instead? If you do like the style / grid layout that I’m showing and want to replace your theme … then checkout the WooThemes range of themes.</description>

      <description>Until a few days ago, I’d been relying on e-mail to manage your support requests. During the past 3 months I’ve looked at different options to provide support and also publish user guides and support material – beyond what’s in the readme files.

      <description>It’s what’s on the inside that counts! For me, what makes RSS a success has been mobile apps with offline caching. I don’t sit at home with my browser pointed to reader.google.com … I use mobile apps. Specifically, as I spend a lot of time on London Tube and trains where there is no wifi or mobile coverage, I need an RSS Feed Reader with a Cache!
It’s been great over the years to have Google Reader there for me as a bit of a research index, record keeper and generally more reliable than Delicious or pretty much any social bookmarking service.</description>

      <description>Isotope Visual Layouts Pro WordPress plugin is easier to use now that it’s using the Twitter Bootstrap framework with great CSS options and features.
Damien’s WordPress plugins have great features that mean you can improve your website and not change your theme. This is ideal for a designer or developer who wants to change the look n feel via custom CSS. Overtime, I’ve come to realise that most people download or buy the plugin on the basis off the look.</description>

The video is taken from my Selenium based testing and goes from plugin install, checking plugin options, adding a page, viewing the results and finally deleting the plugin.

      <description>Reformatting a computer is usually an emotionally distressful activity – involving losing files, trying to find software discs and panic about lost licence codes.
Over the years, I’ve reformatted and deleted many computers – kind of like giving your computer a semi annual service. As a result of noticing something not running right .. it just has to be done.
Today’s reformat went faster then I expected.
Reformat your Apple Mac and reinstall OSx operating system Once you are happy that you have moved all the files you think you want to keep … All you do is:</description>

I woke up this morning .. it’s pouring with rain … my Apple MacBook Pro decides it doesn’t want to connect to my wifi.
So I had to do, what I had to do! and reformatted my Mac.
Now … I’m getting up in running again.
First things first ..

      <description>Isotope Visual Layouts Pro pluginintroduces a click to enlarge feature for box items that are part of the grid layout. This uses a cool jQuery element that changes the CSS class and refreshes the layout of the page.
Checkout the demoand click on each box / image.
It took me a bit to learn how to do this – only cause I’m not a frontend developer. But if you’d like to add toggleClass to your Isotope WordPress project, then you might like this.</description>

      <description>Why use WordPress and Compare WordPress features sound like pretty SEO friendly keywords. Right? And if you’re new to WordPress, you’ll probably see many articles focus on three words – Free, Simple &amp;amp; Easy. These words tell you nothing about WordPress and so this is to help you decide to choose WordPress.
I started using WordPress in 2003 and I still have my hosted account London.WordPress.com. I switched to standalone or self-hosted in 2009 and from 2010, I’ve been running WordPress network or WordPress multisite.</description>

      <description>Visual Layouts is the alternative, responsive, animated, grid layout WordPress plugin. It’s similar to adding isotope and masonry jQuery. Visual Layouts for WordPress is another way that you can change your website without changing your theme.
Now Visual Layouts is turning Pro and the first feature I’ll show off is integration with Twitter Bootstrap CSS.
I think that Twitter Bootstrapis an awesome solution for anyone wanting to use good web design concepts – of course, the internet might be pretty ‘bland’ if we all used this framework.</description>

And so I did …
 I’m a WordPress developer in the UK and I look after a plugin called DBC-Backup-2.
I’ve always loved DBC-Backup ( a plugin you are are using on your website ), so when I found out that no one was maintaining it, I decided to ‘adopt’ DBC-Backup.</description>

      <description>A new version of DBC Backup 2 has been released. I’m doing this to make life just a little bit harder. You should update to v2.1.1 as soon as possible please.
What’s in this release? This release looks to address a common security issue with WordPress and browsing folders like /wp-content etc.
I also recommend all users of my plugin and WordPress to check that their .htaccess file includes this 1 line (well 2 lines):</description>

      <description>There are many ways to skin a cat and trying to use Selenium with WordPress CLI is new to me. Essentially, WordPress is ‘just’ a dynamic website using a SQL database with some themes and plugin files behind it.
Selenium is designed as a frontend browser test tool so keep that in mind for a minute and I assume you mean Selenium IDE. The result would be very brittle test cases if you built something up with Selenium IDE + WordPress CLI.</description>

      <description>“WP to Buffer is a plugin for WordPress that sends updates to your Buffer (bufferapp.com) account for scheduled publishing to social networks when you publish and/or update WordPress Pages, Posts and/or Custom Post Types.”
— Now I like Buffer a lot … I use it mostly via Twitter to ‘Buffer’ my tweets at different times of the day.
If you don’t already have a plugin to send your scheduled posts to Twitter then here’s a plugin to try that will send them to your Buffer queue.</description>

      <description>Isotope Visual Layouts my plugin for WordPress will soon be updated to version 1. This is a big milestone for me and from my perspective, the plugin will be ‘out of beta’.
I think, I have been talking about this for some time … but it’s been a bit harder for me to finish as I started a new job and need to commute out of London every day. I have also been working on another plugin and wanted to re-use what I have learnt / built from that project.</description>

      <description>Integrating Twitter with WordPress is pretty easy to do without a plugin. With a few lines of code you can have a nice tweet this or follow me button on every post or page of your WordPress website.
However, the URL that is part of the Tweet is the permalink URL and for many sites you’ll want to Tweet a shortened URL. If like me, using Bit.ly and Yoast’s Bitly Shortlink plugin, you maybe wondering how to get your short Bit.</description>

      <description>It is easy to stop most WordPress comment spam instantly with one small change to your theme’s functions.php. This is one of my favourite WordPress functions and I use it on all my setups.
This code snippet works by blocking comments from being added offsite or indirectly and not from the comment box on your webpage. Most spammers try to automate their ‘workload’ and try to exploit WordPress functions that allow you to manage comments or add posts via the WordPress API’s.</description>

      <description>In WordPress going mobile is easy … you could actually find that your website theme is already Responsive, so maybe ‘doing nothing’ is a valid answer.
What are your choices to mobilise a WordPress Website? You have 4 choices
 Choose a Responsive Theme for your site (Responsive adapts for different screen sizes) most work from WooThemes is now responsive. Choose a plugin (such as WPTouchPro– which is both plugin and theme) Build a second site which you access at m.</description>

      <description>Isotope Visual Post Layouts for WordPress has just been updated. As the plugin is no-longer in the WordPress repo (it’s not GPL compliant) … you’ll need to download this plugin and install it manually.
 Whats new in v0.33? In advance of further development, I decided it was best to introduce update notifications so that ‘you’ can be alerted to any new updates.
What this means is your WordPress dashboard will in future let you know of future releases.</description>

And annoyingly all map data is now from some sat nav company so you can&amp;rsquo;t get walking directions.</description>

It can be applied to a container element and it will attempt to arrange it’s children in a layout that makes optimal use of screen space, by “packing” them in a tight arrangement.</description>

      <title>Pros and Cons of Post Formats vs. WordPress Multisite</title>

      <description>WordPress is a flexible solution for web publishing. Post Formats were introduced a couple of years back to help users and developers to create content in one WYSIWYG Editorbut show it differently on the site. I’ll start by saying that there is quite a bit of press about why there is a general lack of support by theme developers for post formats(see one example below).
– If you have a theme which doesn’t support post formats (most don’t) then you can’t start this way.</description>

      <description>Announcing DBC Backup 2, a WordPress plugin to backup your WordPress SQL database is now available from WordPress Plugins.
DBC Backup 2 creates a SQL export and saves a compressed file to your web host server. Many web hosts provide large amounts of free space for storing your data so it makes sense to use this free space to safely store your database.
Key Features  Save time – set a Batch Job to run daily, weekly, monthly User Control – User defined path to store backups Compact – Compression of SQL exports (Gzip or Tar) saves space Safe – the export folder is ‘protected’ from prying eyes or direct downloads Save money – Uses web host to store export backups  Revival of DBC Backup The plugin is a revival of a much older plugin that I have used for a couple of years now.</description>

Treating Social Media as a separate activity from the rest of your marketing is a No-No … In fact social media should be integrated into every campaign or promotion.
Digital marketing fits into new customer acquisition, customer retention, CRM, customer engagement and loyalty and anything else that customers do and thats true for D2C brands as well as B2B marketers.</description>

      <description>WordPress gets a major update about twice a year. If you’re responsible for doing the upgrade here’s a pre-update checklist for WordPress to help you identify any bugs that will get in the way of a flawless update.
The main point of the checklist is to reduce risk of failure by helping you identifying potential issues and roadblocks and give you confidence in a fast update process.
A second point to remember is the cost of not running the update – staying on an older version of WordPress can expose you to security issues which are fixed in the new update and also make it harder at a later time to run an update.</description>

      <description>Social Gaming is on the decline – not terminal decline, just platform cannibalisation. Well mostly. Some Social Gamers just go off and play other newer games. The big reason for the decline in social game, I believe is the rise of free games in App Stores like Android Play and iTunes App Store. These App Stores provide a direct to user channel for promotion of games.

      <description>Isotope is an ‘exquisite jQuery plugin for magical layouts’ which basically means it works wonders on responsive layouts. I’ve created a WordPress plugin for Isotope and just updated this to add Filtering by Categories.


How do you add Filtering for Isotope to WordPress? WordPress uses jQuery in no conflict mode. so you just need to modify the Isotope example code

      <description>Have you ever used an app, thought you saved the settings and then you check and nothing changes … It happens all the time with MobileRSS. This has been bugging me for awhile now. Usually I think I’m not the only one who spots these things …
The funny thing is, a preference change needs to be done in 3 parts
 the visual UI/UE cue to let you know something changed (like a tick or a save button changes text) the backend data / prefs change is stored the app ‘reloads’ with the new settings  So what goes wrong with saving state changes?</description>

Once installed, the plugin adds the right code to call the Isotope javascript file and a custom stylesheet. But because Isotope has a commercial licence (and I’m not a great WordPress developer) you need to go buy a licence and move the .</description>

I like this application and I was researching text overflow and scrolling. Since iPad no longer shows scrollbars then it’s up to the user to figure what is scrolling or not.</description>

      <description>Siegeis a great tool for performance and load testing your web application. I’ve been using it for the past 6 months to test WordPress websites along with other web apps that we’ve been building.
Use it to straighten out any kinks with applications like WordPress, learn if you’re server and database is flakey or prove that your CDN is super.

      <description>It’s not often that we (as app user or developers) stop to consider how important the First Time User experience or the Getting Started Guide is.
If you had never heard of Evernote (or many other apps) then you rely on this introduction to do a lot of things. To sum it up, the first time user experience has to do two things:
 sell the customer that the app will do what the user thinks it will do (they’ve already installed it but app store descriptions can be misleading), and; tell the customer how to use it  Ultimately, large multi-platform applications have many, many, more features then there is time for a Quick Start Guide or First Time User experience.</description>

      <description>It’s pretty easy to jump in the deep end with Axure and start building wireframes and hi-fi clickable prototypes. But the joy of Axure is starting low-fi (use Post-It Notes) to map a user journey and then create this process flow in Axure. Following a workflow like this means you get the customer journey mapped and you easily link your Axure wireframes to business processes.
I’ve been using Axure for more than a year and it’s now my tool of choice for mapping customer journeys and user interaction design.</description>

I’ve read some great stuff about how to use Storify to archive events (weddings for example). Using Storify you can collect all the tweets, Facebook messages, Flickr pictures into a ‘story’. Sounds good so far.
But what if you’re creative and not a creative writer? What if you just don’t have enough going on in your life?</description>

It’s hard to get traction with social networks as we are likely to be regular users of a few social networks. It’s harder still to get people to change their primary social network of choice when your online social network all still use The Facebook.

      <description>I’ve just getting started automated testing with Selenium for a number of web appprojects that we’ve been developing lately. My background has been all about managing the project, test plans and manual test execution, so the learning curve is a bit steep.
Automated testing fits in well with Agile and Scrum project management. Using Selenium IDE you can first create the test case, try it out manually and then when development is finished, you just run the automated test.</description>

Even though the app is not universal – you can see Google+ has high-res / retina display assets and so it renders quite ‘crisp’ even at 2x zoom on the iPad.
This is great job using fonts and HTML elements so the overall effect is impressive.</description>

      <description>Hats Off (HT) to Wired UK for the tip about Curators’s Code. What’s the Curator’s Codeyou might well ask … Actually it’s a great idea to make content attribution easier and recognise that not everything you read on the Internet is new.
Content Attribution is not a licence to use It’s great idea to always attribute and recognise your info sources – I should think it is mandatory if you are aggregatingcontent (which is almost akin to stealing someone else’s work).</description>

      <description>WordPress introduced custom post types allowing creative and technical types to do more then just write pages and posts. Your websites main RSS feed doesn’t include custom post types — but custom posts do have their own unique RSS feeds which you can use.
What’s the RSS feed for custom posts? The custom post rss feed looks like this

      <description>Do you have problems with read / write permissions with WordPress? Are you stuck and can’t upload or change files? If you’ve tried to change the CHMOD values and failed, it might be time to go to the command-line.
Working Alone – Single WordPress site Run these commands from terminal (command line interface) or ask your web host provider to do this. This will set all files to read/write for the owner and read only for everything else.</description>

      <description>When ever there is a security updatefor WordPress you should always update your blog and website as soon as possible. According to Kasperskyone of the reasons that the recent Flashback Mac OSx Trojan malware infected 600,000+ computers was due to infected WordPress websites.
So how did this happen? When developers build you a website there typically is no time or budget left over for maintenance and updates. This means websites can be left running on old versions of WordPress with known security issues and these can be exploited by hackers.</description>

      <description>WordPress 3.3.2 is here … and it’s not to be confused with the 3.4 beta releases. Being a point release, you shouldn’t expect significant changes.
WordPress 3.3.2 is a security release, which means it’s critical that you update your site. The release notefor this
 Media Upload – the Flash Uploader and the newer Plupload have been updated Vulnerability where a site administrator could deactivate network-wide plugins Cross-site scripting vulnerability when making URLs clickable and in redirects after posting comments in older browsers, and when filtering URLs.</description>

Don’t try this at home if you’re new to WordPress.

Piwikis a web analytics solution that is free and runs on your own server. It provides a lot of similar features to Google Analytics and will run alongside Google Analytics anyway.
Why stick with Google Analytics? Now I love GA and will always implement it as a first choice.</description>

      <description>Axure is a really great tool for generating an interactive prototype and doing something more amazing with wireframes.
I’m one step closer to something resembling the current state of responsive and I’ve updated my example of responsive design …. http://share.axure.com/VLO0IZ/If you read anything about responsive or mobile design then check out Luke Wroblewski as he proposes 4 device screen widths to design for.
Using a centred layout with Axure you can cover ‘all’ devices larger then a 1024 / 960 grid (if that’s what you use) — so that’s 2 devices.</description>

This is just a follow-up to an earlier post today on responsive layouts in Axure. It’s easy to make the nav bar responsive and even tested this with rotation. Pinch to zoom also gave some unexpected delight.

Why Integrate Blog and E-mail? Integrating email &amp;amp; social media marketing is already being done by 90% of UK business. So it should be simple to get a sign-up form working with WordPress and Mailchimp.
Annoyingly, a well timed (or placed) pop-up is more likely to get filled in by a visitor if they just read a great post.</description>

Axure is a great tool for making wireframes come to life … seriously. When you’re building a web or mobile application you’re better off with a complete clickable prototype then leaving your client guessing.

Axurehas been my tool of choice for UX / UI wireframing and prototyping since July 2011. It was forced on me. Having been a fan of Omnigraffle and Balsamiq, I was resistant to change. Then I discovered the power of templates, generators and prototypes.</description>

      <description>I’ve just finished a WordPress multi-server development project which required a scalable deployment setup. We also needed to test the setup under load and ended up using Blazemeter (basically jmeter in the cloud).
If you’re setup in Rackspace has a load balancer, you know you need to allow a number of IP’s by modifying the Access Control. Annoyingly there was no 1 list of the CIDR’s to allow. Blazemeter keeps a list of CIDR’sbut this couldn’t be cut n paste into Rackspace.</description>

      <description>If you’re reading this then you must use JIRA or know of someone who has had a JIRA experience. It seems that JIRA is a bit like a Marmite brand – you love it or you hate it. JIRA can be too much effort for many projects – but thats only cause the project can’t find time to build the value in JIRA.
I think that anything which helps take pain away from managing bugs, issues and tasks is brilliant.</description>

      <description>This year, is the year that HTML5 will be on your CV. That is … if only you can prove what you did was in HTML5. Right now, I think that HTML5 is a bit of a catch-phrase (or catchy acronym?) when what we’re all doing uses a lot of .js and other familiar code frameworks.
HTML5 is not a new language – but it is visual Every project I’ve got so far this year will need HTML5.</description>

A lot of regular bloggers and social media consultants insist on blogging everyday. But that’s a chore and regular blogging is part of trying to win at SEO and social media optimisation.</description>

Recently I’ve been looking into fluid and responsive layouts for web design and I’ve been using a jQuery framework called Isotope on my blog page.
Isotope looks like it can do magical things. If only I had the time to make it work properly.

      <description>I’ve decided that designers and creative types like to bundle mobile apps with features that can be near impossible to bring to life. I know I’m going to lose a few ‘friends’ here .. but bare with me a minute.
When developing your first app for your brand or client – it’s more important to engage customers and get usage through having the right features and a flawless function.
Mobile Apps need to be beautiful in form &amp;amp; flawless in function Would you rather an app that is a ‘Thing of Beauty’ or an App that delivers on its function?</description>

The average page load time is now around 5 seconds as reported by Google Analytics – it had been floating between 12 – 20 seconds on various days last week.

What’s in this release?
This release is just 2 weeks after the big update to 3.3 so don’t be expecting anything new. Release 3.3.1 addresses a security issue with ‘cross site scripting’ and 15 other maintenance fixes.</description>

      <description>Welcome to 2012 … and yes, you made it! There is no point in a retrospective, stuff happened and we learn from it. There is no point on pre-guessing what will happen, stuff happens and we react to it.
However you may want to look at it – we made it this far. It’s a new year, so enjoy it … while it lasts.
Thanks

      <description>WordPress makes it easy to publish your site for mobile users. It’s best that you always test your changes on smart phones but did you know that you can check most changes on using your Apple Mac?
 Mobile Internet Solutions WP TouchPro is one of the best solutions to make your site ready for the mobile internet and smart-phone users. The key reason it is so good lies in the fact that it combines both a plugin and has it’s own mobile specific theme.</description>

      <description>WordPress offers lots of plugins to choose from and if you add to many you will soon come across this Fatal Error message. You can easily fix the problem (and then go back to adding more plugins).
This out of memory error doesn’t mean you have to go buy more RAM — just have to amend a line of text in a wordpress settings file.
 Fix the Fatal Error: Allowed Memory Size When you installed WordPress you either uploaded it using FTP yourself or went to an admin cpanel and installed it.</description>

      <description>I’ve been using EvoHostingfor a good couple of years now and have always been impressed by their service and flexibility. I’ve felt my site has suffered in recent months – I just feel the performance has suffered and have few options to speed-up my website.
So sometimes you want more freedom to control your server (like Rackspace), but using a shared server gives you few choices to do this. Here is the solution for WordPress sites hosted by EvoHosting UK which you can implement now.</description>

      <description>WordPress is a great tool. It has its own way of managing updates to your website – and will switch to maintenance mode automatically. Sometimes this is called an HTTP Status 503 Service Unavailable.
For the best user experience you can setup your own custom maintenance page – where you can show your brand, making it clear that this is planned maintenance and give your visitor some where else to go.</description>

      <description>Dear Reader … Hello!
Sorry about the bugs that have been around for the past 2 days. At the start of this week I changed my caching solution and then I started to use a content delivery network.
The combination of both changes – and also having other things to do had led to a rather large ‘outage’ on Monday. Migrating content to the CDN is also still a bit problematic.</description>

      <description>Thinkup - If you want to run your own social media monitoring tool then try this. I&amp;rsquo;ve just installed it, which takes a little bit of time and you need to know some a little bit of how to create your own mySQL databases. If you can&amp;rsquo;t afford to pay for tools - then ThinkUp creates the archive and monitoring you have to have.
Some great features include:
 downloads all your tweets, status updates, etc provides options to retweet, etc creates a visual report on followers, trends, etc deep integration with API&amp;rsquo;s for Twitter, Facebook &amp;amp; Google+ it&amp;rsquo;s free   Are you trying out tools for social media monitoring and analytics?</description>

      <description>Everyone I talk to in digital marketing and everyone who wants to be a technical expert has an opinion on Rackspace. In reality, when it comes to virtualisation, hosting servers, scalability and choice, the price you pay to Rackspace can be significantly less then you pay to other providers.
But at what cost? It seems that freedom is the price you pay and freedom to choose is confusing.
1p per hour for a server is a problem The problem with Rackspace is the pricing model.</description>

      <description>So what do you think of the new look for Twitter? It’s feeling cleaner and the style change adds some freshness.

But is this the first step in the wrong direction for brand pages? Will we all end-up with old-skool MySpace style pages?</description>

      <description>WordPressis one of the most popular solutions for blogging. What people don’t know is that WordPress self hosted is the best solution for building a standalone B2B or SME company website. We recently finished the migration of the mmCHANNEL company website from an in-house developed website (using PHP, etc) to single install, self hosted WordPress installation.
There were a few times when I felt that maybe WordPress wasn’t right, but overall it’s going great and the results are visible!</description>

Revolutionary is only for Linux or Windows users and really supports the newer range of Android devices like the HTC Sensation</description>

      <description>WordPress 3.3 is on its way … the latest beta 3.3 is now available, which means you can download it and try it for yourself. This beta doesn’t add anything new, as the official post says ‘it’s all about making things prettier’ along with lots of bug fixes.
Typically you can expect to get a release candidate after this and then the official thing will be here.
Should I update to this beta?</description>

      <description>Social Media Marketing is a growing body of knowledge and everything about ‘it’ is in a state of flux and changing rapidly, It’s unfair to call anything a bible. I doubt this book will be around in 2000 years – and it’s twice as fat as any bible you might see today.
Admirably, I agree with the authors intention – to collect a lot of (good) writing in one place … but the material in this book has aged already and which means the book is only worth it at a discounted rate or for anyone starting out with their own website or social media novice.</description>

Managing Leads, Contacts and Accounts is a critical function of your business and it’s just as important that you understand Zoho’s sales management process.</description>

      <description>What was your first computer? The first computer I had regular use of was kept locked up in my school’s library. It was an Apple IIe with a green monochrome monitor. At 9 years of age, I was hooked.

Growing up far, far away where the most important news of the day was NZ losing its number 1 market for dairy and lamb as the UK joined the ‘EU’ – a piece of technology like the Apple IIe probably cost the world.</description>

      <description>Recently I discovered Axure as a tool for mapping user experience – and I have to say it’s pretty damn good. Given that its also able to generate clickable prototypes along with documentation like functional specifications this is more then pretty damn good. It’s a powerful tool – but if you’re building user journeys, wire framing and process flows can be easier to do in other tools.
It’s hard to compare Axure to Balsamiq, Visio or Omnigraffle – particularly on price since Axure starts at around $580 per licence.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re getting started with Social Media marketing then you need at least 1 web based tool to help you.
For most businesses and individuals, social media marketing starts and ends with Tweetdeck. Which provides an all-in-one solution for pushing content direct from your machine. You need better tools for planning and managing your social media marketing.
However browser based tools for social media marketing are better suited for team or office environs – or if you&amp;rsquo;re like me, someone on the road in different offices who can&amp;rsquo;t have Tweetdeck open all the time.</description>

      <description>If you’re about to head off for some sun – do pack these 2 books so you can say you seriously did some ‘work’.
Why Do I need to know these books? You need to know about current tools and the best practices as they are already appearing in many business plans, marketing strategy or new product definitions.
If you evaluate startups and are not getting a business model canvas then you should tell them to go re-write their business pan.</description>

      <description>Monday will now be called DEAD MAC DAY – July 4, 2011
I didn’t even have a chance to say goodbye … I just came home to a mac with a flashing folder when I opened the lid.
Lucky for me, it’s my newest mac … Unlucky for me I lost most of a weekends’ work including e nearly finished guide to foursquare.
So that’s actually going to change a heap of plans … The apple store has completed my repair so I just hope it was only a faulty hard drive connector cable.</description>

      <description>It is easy to stop most WordPress comment spam instantly with one small change to your theme’s functions.php. This is one of my favourite WordPress functions and I use it on all my setups.
This code snippet works by blocking comments from being added offsite or indirectly and not from the comment box on your webpage.
Just to prove this works … take a look at your spam comments now and mentally calculate your daily average of new spam comments.</description>

      <description>The second release candidate for the next version of WordPress 3.2 is here. If you haven’t started testing 3.2, now is the time. Previous experience would make this the final RC before the real deal.
 Should I update to this release candidate? As this is a release candidate you shouldn’t use this on a really important live site – but it does mean it’s pretty stable and useful. You should find that most popular plugins and themes have no issues as developers have been working since RC1.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone … I hope your June is going well? I’ve been away on holiday for the past week taking some time to visit colleagues and friends in Madrid.
 While I’ve been away, I’ve been researching and taking notes for a range of new features on social media, marketing strategy and mobile consulting.
 Watch-out from Monday!
 And I hope you’re enjoying your summer / winter

      <description>The first release candidate for the next version of WordPress 3.2 is here.
Should I update to this release candidate? As this is a release candidate you shouldn’t use this on a really important live site – but it does mean it’s pretty stable and useful. You may find that you have issues with plugins and themes as developers work to support this RC.

      <description>What could we do to make this site more useful? That’s a good question … and thanks to Kiss Insights its really easy to ask this of your website visitors.
It’s only one answer &amp;amp; takes one second Web surveys should not be a bore and they should not be too long. We’re all so busy now and being asked to spend 15 mins on a survey is pointless.
I guess that’s what makes the KISS approach so powerful – keep it short and simple.</description>

      <description>Digital marketing has its benefits mainly that it’s easy to launch a social media campaign without any prior relationship with the victim.
I’m more annoyed at the damage young companies do to their brand, reputation and domain-name … at wasted opportunities from legitimate startups who just spam any contacts in one e-mail blast.
Last week, I got an email sent to me with someone elses info – yet it was an invite to join their London business network.</description>

Emailvision are big news, they put the power into sites like http://alltop.com/ aka Guy Kawasaki … I’d like to learn more about them.

My interests in social media do extend to ‘the Facebook’ – but my expertise is definitely not with that network. Given a limited number of hours in each day, I have enough social media stuff to do.
Facebook Comments Only a few months back, Facebook launched their own comments system allowing external websites an easy way to integrate with Facebooks own commenting system.</description>

      <description>I’ll start by saying I’m a gadget boy — any marketing consultant working on innovation or product delivery has got to know about gadgets. When I got my first iPad last year, I quickly realised that my finger tip was useless for writing. I’ve been collecting styli or styluses and starting to get a good collection.
I have been stopped plenty of times to be asked what’s my preferred tool and over the past 12 months, I’ve used quite a few and thrown out some immediately.</description>

      <description>With any successful blog, Comments and Spam are juxtaposed at opposite ends of the spectrum. We all want to engage and generate conversations. The change in SEO practices means spam is being replaced by inbound link baiting.
Akismet the only rubber you need In WordPress – part of the battle is won by using the free Akismet plugin which is developed and maintained by Automattic (the ‘commercial arm’ of WordPress.com etc).</description>

      <description>If you’re reading and researching Why WordPress – you’ll probably see many articles focus on three words – Free, Simple &amp;amp; Easy. These words tell you nothing about WordPress and so I started writing this to help you decide to choose WordPress.
I started using WordPress in 2003 and I still have my hosted account London.WordPress.com. I switched to self-hosted in 2009.
For me, I’ve chosen WordPress because
 WordPress is something I use everyday I recommend WordPress to clients and friends WordPress integrates in a social media marketing strategy WordPress can morph from a blog to a website or a CMS Getting started is hassle-free   WordPress is right to use everydayWordPress, it’s mobile app, plugins and 3rdparty tools are improving – this makes WordPress something I enjoy using every day.</description>

      <description>TRONis still a superb film, I was too young when it was first issued, but watching it recently started me thinking about business strategy and business models for startups.
In basic sociology, we learn that society is reflected in films and films are (then) reflected back in society. What this means is that you can analyse a film to learn about (business) culture from that time and look to see if any stereotypes are carried forward into reality.</description>

      <description>WordPress just updated to 3.1.3 and so that means it’s time to update your WordPress install. This is a security update for all previous WordPress versions so that means it’s a mandatory update.
 What’s in this release?There isn’t much from a user or admin perspective, but you don’t normally expect that in a point release. If you do a lot of WordPress support or development changes to the import process and media file management maybe of interest.</description>

      <description>Mobile user experience and interface design is tricky business at the best of time. You need tools and templates that can help quickly sketch or mockup what things will look like which is where Balsamiq comes in.
Back in 2008 I started to use Balsamiq Mockups for sketches of mobile UX/UI for mobile operator content portals. This isn’t easy work at the best of times. Launched in June 2008, Mockups helps software designers and developers build great software by letting them easily sketch out their ideas, then quickly collaborate and iterate over them.</description>

      <description>You’re never too late to start your 2011 Social Media Marketing Strategy – This year has gone so fast and I missed starting my Marketing Strategy on 1/1/11. For many marketing people and businesses, developing your strategy is something usually done in the first 3 months of your financial year or calendar year.
If this is the approach your business currently takes, then realise that you’re leaving just 75% of the year to deliver 100% of what you set out to achieve.</description>

      <description>Google recently announced some exciting new features for Android 3.0 Honeycomb. Most notably, Android 3.0 sees tablets and mobile devices merge to the same code base. This is kind of like having one OS for all devices. There are interface design considerations that need to be understood before launching your app on the big screen.
Android Apps run full screen – Interface Design The key point to note is that Android apps run in full screen on tablets.</description>

      <description>Well hello Customer Service and Customer Management consultants … who here is reading this and is building a business case for improved customer service by moving customers to self care tools such as web forms and e-mail? Most of you reading this are probably think about it constantly. THEN DON’T DO IT unless you’ve gone and tested it and got it right.
I recently got an iPad 2 – an upgrade from my first iPad … Some nice marketing product person at O2 figured out an email with a link to reset the iPad MAC address so I can continue to use free wifi would be helpful.</description>

      <description>This billboard stands out as an example – Just an example of how disconnected ‘real world’ traditional marketing is from integrated digital marketing.
Great – several airlines have now got mobile apps that allow you to seemingly, easily get from home to the airplane.
What’s wrong with this advert?   It’s only for iPhone – the image tells me straight away that here is another brand ignoring ‘other’ smartphones (or the only customers BA is helping are iOS device users)</description>

      <description>Redmine is described as a flexible project management web application SaaS. I’ve been using it for the past 5 months within a mobile marketing agency – where its used for testing, operations, work orders, issue management and its wiki is used for documentation.
Redmine can not be compared to other bug track, issues or fault management systems like JIRA or CRM platforms with helpdesk tools. It’s flexible, but that comes with a price.</description>

You’ll see more changes like this to come – I suggest a single name brand might be one ‘strategy’ that I’m going to follow.</description>

      <title>Switching to Scrivener for WordPress blogging</title>

      <guid>https://damien1.github.io/wordpress/switching-to-scrivener-for-wordpress-blogging-2901/</guid>
      <description>I’ve just made the switch – or as we speak, I’m starting to learn about this ‘new’ tool for writers called Scrivener. Described as the app for writers, journalists and anyone that needs to write short or long stories, Scrivener collects together scraps of articles, research material and helps to draft your writing.
To me, the biggest problem with regular blogging is the interface. If you blog on the go then you already know that the WordPress admin suite is not very accessible when you’re in a plane, train or automobile.</description>

      <description>Mobile apps can be fun to use – but during mobile app testing you might need to diagnosing problems and finding bugs can be complicated. At least with Network Info II on your Android you have a pocket-encyclopedia with all the important information you need.
At the basic level – Network Info II reports details on your mobile network connection, IP address, Wi-Fi connection, Bluetooth and details about your device and your sim card.</description>

      <description>Is z4root the easiest tool? If you’ve been keeping up with the world of custom rom’s to root your Android you may have heard about this.
z4root doesn’t get much of a mention – its key differentiator is that it is an untethered root tool – eg you run it from your mobile and not from your PC or Mac.
I’ve got a Samsung Galaxy Europa prepay on Vodafone UK – I needed to do screenshots and the only good way to do this involves running root first.</description>

      <description>What shortcuts or widgets should you save to the desktop of you Anrdoid phone? As a marketing consultant I’ve customised my phone lots (thanks to Cyanogenmod) .. but my desktop stays the same.
I don’t have many widgets as they eat up battery life (and annoyingly want internet connection).
What’s on your Android Desktop? Winamp – best music player for Android
Now that I have a larger long-life battery – I’m back to listening to music on my phone.</description>

      <description>If you haven’t got an iPad or still not convinced you’ll need one – then you’re kidding yourself. As a marketing consultant new gadgets like the iPad need to be purchased, used extensively and then replaced with the next new shiny gadget. Why – you might ask? Because how else can you have an opinion or recommend a solution to your clients.
Today – I’m taking a quick look at the list of apps featured in iTunes under the category ‘business class’.</description>

      <description>I’ve just discovered the (not official) Last.fm live wallpaper for Android. It’s a brilliant change to my boring background on my HTC Desire.
Last.fm is still there tracking my music listening habits – and doing a good job of that. This live wallpaper has a number of options and the free version allows you to create a wallpaper of your favourite artists for example.
The idea for this (app) is also brilliant – it needs no real user interface – and for a small price you get a premium wallpaper with options for weekly charts.</description>

      <description>Do you do mobile app testing? Then maybe you need a getting started checklist to help you with your device settings. One thing has not changed in the (nearly) 10 years since mobile internet got started – we still have to check and change device settings.
 Check .. Does the mobile operator name show in the status bar?
 if it says No Carrier it wont work  Check … you have a data connection â can you open any app or browse to a web page.</description>

      <description>Where did all my stats go!
That’s a very good question – apparently I’ve been suffering from a problem that Google no longer likes my domain name. This is a very nasty problem – even more so because the error message offers very little hope.
  The site “http://damien.co” has not been registered.
  My site is registered with Google Webmaster, I use Google Apps for my Domain — what else is there that needs to be Google-ified?</description>

      <description>I’m not one to always login to Facebook … It’s a good week if I don’t log in at all. But for about 500 million people Facebook is pretty important.
As if Facebook really needed to tell you to bookmark their site if you already go there – but this bookmarket / on-site advertising is a fresh change to the usual page prompting you to login from your mobile.

      <description>Apple has updated its Aperture software to 3.1.2 – it seems to focus on the new users who quite likely brought the Appstore copy.
The release note is not very useful – but maybe the adjustments will be interesting to see what happens.

      <description>Australians spend 1 in 5 minutes using social media sites. Social Networking usage was about 22% in December 2010 says comScore.
The statistics reveal that Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn are some of the most popular destinations. If you add into this instant messaging then the total rises to 35% – which is probably a more realistic definition of social networking.
There is a presentation you can download with really good insights on internet usage across Australia.</description>

      <description>I just updated my HTC Desire to the new Cyanogenmod 7 rom and it’s been running fine. A part of me does miss the HTC Sense UE overlay .. but … meh. If you have already rooted your phone and been using Clockwork ROM Manager, you just need to go looking for the new Cyanogenmod 7 RC1.
The upgrade process is very simple – but here are a couple of pointers –</description>

      <description>If you’re reading this you would have noticed I’m having problems with my WordPress and I had a Catchable Fatal Error. It’s now on the path to recovery. The issue has been rectified – but not resolved. The problem started after I relied too much on Softaculous which is used by my hosting provider to update all my WordPress sites.
So always keep a backup and a backup of that backup … it makes life easier to recover from.</description>

      <description>Android users tend to download fewer apps – and this is because there is no computer application to easily browse and download apps in the same way that iTunes works for iOS devices. A few weeks back the revamped Android Market website was launched. But it still struggles to tie the phone to the computer.
Android Market revamped The Android Market website has been around for a couple of years and generally featured static content.</description>

      <description>So London Startup Weekend will happen … it has taken a lot longer to get the next weekend event going then we all thought. To be honest, Startup Weekend takes time and patience – patiently working with venue sponsors, helping them to gain internal approval and working through security issues.
Patience takes time .. so the next Startup Weekend will be happening soon. We’ve now got a team of about 6 people to work on London Startup Weekend and hopefully soon we’ll have a venue to really consider.</description>

Tags like and are redundant – instead and have been in use for a few years by many blogging and web developer tools. Now the HTML5 standard recognises that and should only be used for visual style.

2010 Where are the results! Given that Apple, Android, RIM, Nokia and a whole stack of operators and 3rd parties run mobile app stores – it’s extremely difficult to find out how good Gartner is at forecasts. Or is this just a large number guestimate?</description>

      <description>Each week I set aside time to good writing, but its not the same when each day there are technical documents and scrum artefacts to be prepared. I can’t guarantee to get my writing done. It just doesn’t work like that. Good productive writingtakes time, space and zero distractions – even when its a business process or project brief.

      <description>For over a year now, Sunday has been my day to work. On Sundays, I’ve blocked out a few hours for the productive writing process. I’ve been a trained technical writer for more than 10 years now. I know I can write beautiful prose, except it’s the kind of prose worthy of legal contracts and business processes. Nowadays I’m trying to be more faithful to this skill and be creative in my writing.</description>

      <description>I’ve been using Apple Aperture 3 for my digital photography and image processing for a couple of years. It’s great for importing those images for clients and quickly doing all the editing, tagging, grouping and touch-ups.
What I didn’t like about it as a workflow tool – is that it lacks proper integration with Flickr. In the 3.0 version from last year you could publish as a Set of photos to Flickr, but couldn’t just add an image to your photostream.</description>

      <description>It was only earlier this week that Apple’s homepage changed to advertise the fact that a 10 billion milestone was soon to be reached.
It wouldn’t be insane to think that 10 billion app downloads is a milestone and a half – no other app store or mobile operator portal has reported such impressive download figures.
In other recent news e-marketer reckoned that we all had a collective average of 60 of these apps on our smartphones — that’s a lot of games, news, branded content and generally important little bits of code on our phones.</description>

Effectively any Digital Signage or Outdoor Advertising is now a target. As the advertising gets smarter and more technical – a new breed of criminals will target the computers and mobiles that power them.</description>

      <description>Mayor-ry New Year Foursquare friends and fans. I just gave up my 30 odd Mayorships because its more fun watching other people become Mayor and because I saw that longtime users (including me) are guilty of using Foursquare so much that newer users are stopped from getting to be Mayor.
So now that I have no Mayor-ships does that mean I’m not interested in Foursquare? — No way, but I’m going to watch more venues and continue to monitor its growth.</description>

30 November 2010WordPress 3.0.2 was a mandatory security update.
This was the first update in nearly 6 months so it was a surprise that barely a week later we get another update.
8 December 2010WordPress 3.0.3 came out as an update for all previous versions of WordPress.</description>

      <description>Foursquare this week should break through the 5 million users mark and it has taken about 8 weeks to add an extra million. While Foursquare is still the most popular of the location based social networks (anyone using SCVNGR??) other services are making a better play at location marketing.Slow down in the rate of new users The latest RJ Metrics graphic for Foursquare convincingly shows the decline in the week on week growth of new users.</description>

      <description>LinkedInhas been the business social networkof choice for many and its nearly 10 years old, but younger upstarts have such a mass that its time to look at what LinkedIn can offer to social media marketing, especially for b2b marketing.
There is value in personally knowing your connection When LinkedIn first launched it was not much more than a way to list your work history and connect with business colleagues. It was even important that you had the email address of someone before you could add them – which meant at least you had their business card as people wouldn’t accept requests to connect if they couldn’t remember how they met you.</description>

      <description>So its mid-November and I’m just looking at the Google Analytics report to see how I’m getting on. Data visualisation is a big thing but raw numbers are also pretty good.20,000 visitors so far this year generated 50,000 page views.
That’s pretty good for a one man marketing guy and his machine.
Alexa’s Web Information also seems interesting – and if you don’t know what Alexa says about your site .</description>

      <description>I was having a catchup with a go0d friend this evening and he reminded me that every startup or or new venture needs to solve a problem.Mobile Communications is a major innovator Of course the mobile phone is a big problem solver and I think its referred to as a game changing innovation – but the game change didn’t happen until mass market usage started to drive demand … and it’s only now, as the price the customer pays for some mobile calls is near to zero (not free, you’re using bundles of minutes now) that you can say ‘talk is cheap’.</description>

      <description>So you decided to jump right in and try your own social media marketing event. Here is some more detail for planning a Foursquare Swarm Badge Party.There are no assumptions here … take a look at my Foursquare case study to see how this worked.
Your Target market You’re targeting customers who already have smart phones and potential customers too who use Foursquare. So you better get an RSVP attendees list going and have a competition on the day to collect details of new leads.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was Remembrance Sunday in the UK. For a lot of people its more significant than the 2 minute silence on 11 November because they are out doing things related to their cause – remembering the ones who have gone before us, visiting relatives that are veterans or just being the Carer to someone who was injured during service.
This made me think about how social media marketing can play a part in cause related marketing and what I would do to support my cause.</description>

      <description>As I’m a certified Scrum Master and very good at project and task management I can say I enjoy running planning sessions with teams I do work with. Now I’ve started to discover the freedom of the Post-It Note for planning and brainstorming.

Even better, its essential for any startup to be able to focus on what has to be done and avoid distractions like outsiders wanting extra work or changes to scope.</description>

      <description>I’m going to copy here an opinion piecefrom the Guardian’s Comment is free section. It’s about a social media campaign related to the Twitter hashtag #ukuncuts which is impacting VodafoneUK — Vodafone has been facing protests &amp;amp; flashmobs in the past few weeks, something about 6 billion pounds and a few people think the UK Gov’t could do with the money.

      <description>I’m the type who is always overwhelmed by TV advertising– as I don’t watch ‘live’ TV or commercial TV with ads I often find myself watching adverts on the internet for the sake of it! I even occasionally, download these adverts to save them and watch them again and again and again and …Can I just say I’m against flashmobs, my new found British sensibility (*read – I’ve just handed in my UK citizenship application) does not condone such public displays – it’s embarrassing and I was overexposed to the last T-mobile flashmob thanks to my gyms in-house digital signage.</description>

      <description>LinkedInhas changed its settings so that basic or free users can now find out who actually looked at their profile in the last week. This cool new feature can be found on the LinkedIn website– but you have to first change your own privacy settings from anonymous to share in the benefits of profile stats. I guess its the business persons equivalent of a Facebook poke or like.
Check it out … and while you’re at it – add me as a colleague on LinkedIn</description>

      <description>Some days I think a spring cleanis just as good for you as taking a holiday. Out with the old and give yourself some more space to create a mess.
Take for example this website – its built using WordPress and being very critical about the quality of my work or ‘portfolio’, I always want to be tweaking and changing my website and lookg at ways to make things better. So thankfully, today Woothemes(who I use with all my projects) came out with a new magazine layout that I’ve installed already.</description>

      <description>Most of Europeans don’t understand Halloween and joke about the idea of going out to trick or treat. But at least your average Foursquare user can share in the Halloween spirit even if no one else does.
In order to score Halloween 2010 badge (above, at right), simply check in anytime this weekend, anywhere on Foursquare, but make sure to shout “Happy Halloween!” when you do.</description>

      <description>This news from Hutchison 3G UK shows that using social media is more important on their mobile network is interesting …. Keeping up to date with friends or regular gameplay on the move is now more important than checking emails or reading the news. 
In my opinion, Social Networking continues to dominate growth in internet usage – however, you shouldn’t assume that its all fun on the go. Social Media sites like Twitter, Facebook and LinkedInare all used for b2b leads and d2c customer service.</description>

      <description>So .. Thanks to Amazon and Royal Mail at 730am I received my copy of Office for Mac 2011. Most obvious change is that the floating palette or toolbox is gone, replaced by the Ribbon which has been in Windows Version for a few years.
It now seems way way faster … Once one office app is open, the others open bleedingly fast. So they must now share more of a common backend.</description>

      <description>I recently answered a question on LinkedIn Answers about workplace policies for staff and contractors. Policies should cover acceptable internet &amp;amp; email usage, social media and also mobiles or other tools of trade.3 Policies every workplace should have for staff and new starters You should have policies for-
 social media policy to explain what people can do at work internet and email usage policy so staff know its ok to use email or internet Cellphone or mobile policy be clear about who pays for what  I think in a positive world, such policies should talk about trust and transparency – so the tone should be positive for example:</description>

Today’s Tuesday and now I see the #failure of such a challenge.iWork Pages can’t convert Word documents so easily I’ve been sent a word document to review for a friend – that should be easy as iWork opens Microsoft Office Word .docx formats. The document opens ok … but the content has been placed into separate textblocks on the page just like any traditional desktop publishing app would do – but of course this was supposed to be a document that needed to be cleaned up.</description>

I’m a smart guy … I know I love Office for Mac(powerpoint makes any presentation look hot) – but maybe I can be doing sexy presentations in Keynote instead.So I’ve not got Office on my Mac and will let you know – I anticipate that I’ll be frustrated by Pages and its desktop publishing layouts but I should get used to that quickly.</description>

I had felt that it was starting to run a bit slow than ‘normal’ and I recently had a problem with a kernel panic (caused when testing a up to 21mb USB modem). So I have a ‘clean’ new computer and that has also given me a chance to think about what to reinstall.</description>

      <description>Eastern Europe might not be where you would expect to find social media marketing being trialled ‘so soon’. In Latvia, this week a Foursquare Swarm Badgeparty is being organised by a local mobile operator Bite Latvija.Latvia is fairly new to smart phones – but Twitter has been embraced by internet users – first for finding and following news stories and now Twitter is more popular than Facebook. So it must be possible to get 50 people in a room with a joint interest in new technology and mobile phones.</description>

      <description>Are Twitter Followers better than Facebook Fanswas a topic discussed on emarketer recently. It’s a question I get asked all the time – relatively speaking – Which is the best social network to start social media marketing? The thing is you need to try them both at the same time.And here is the problem every social network has its pro’s and cons – and here is the answer. If you were a criminal, on trial in the Old Bailey, the prosecution’s job is to prove you had the intention of committing a crime, so it was just an accident.</description>

      <description>Foursquare, one of my favourite location based mobile social networks has changed its rules for the game of ‘who wants to be a Mayor’. Foursquare is growing in popularity in a number of cities and rules for game play have been tightened.
Recently it changed the rules to the most checkins in the past 60 days .. and now it has changed to only 1 checkin is valid each day.</description>

      <description>Lithuania is a basketball crazy nation – which may seem odd if you know little about this newer European Union state. Lithuania has had a long history with basketball even in the days of the Soviet Union (USSR).
Lithuania will also be hosting the Mens European Championships in summer 2011. Something to look forward too. I guess as the days grow darker and colder, indoor team sports like Basketball are good for the fans and the players.</description>

      <description>Foursquaretoday is the most popular mobile checkin app in Vilnius, Lithuania. While not everyone here can afford the iPhone – many people are using Foursquare on their Blackberry.
Point of note – Blackberry App World is not available in Lithuania and so people are using hacks to install this.
Here’s a couple of screenshots from Checkin Mania confirming the number of venues is great in Foursquare vs Gowalla in the central old town area.</description>

      <description>In Lithuania mobile penetration is almost at 150% – so is this all from younger people sim swapping?

Mobile Youth in Lithuania (16-24 yo) are all using multi-sims for the best deals and free calls. The 3 main operators are Omnitel, Bite and Tele2. Freedom of choice means that handsets are not subsidised very much and customers have to pay full price for a phone. Even the the ‘popular’ iPhone is over priced and still exclusive with one operator and on a 24 month contract.</description>

      <description>In Lithuania the usage of the internet is reaching saturation point. A 2009 official report shows 95% of young people aged 16-24 with internet access**.**
Lithuania has one of the highest per capita access to broadband ratios due to small land mass and population of just under 4 million. It’s also atypical of ‘westernised’ European markets and the Lithuanian youth are no different – wanting mobile phones, good clothes, good education and a future with a good job (most likely in London).</description>

RJ Metrics monitors both services and predicts Gowalla’s user base will shortly make it to 350,000.Somewhere amongst the stats, you’ll see new users for Gowalla are growing around 2,000 per week but Foursquare recently peaked at 20,000 new users. Summer is usually quieter months for data revenue and usage (same for Jan &amp;amp; Feb Downunder), it will be interesting to track the user take up and usage to see if this is different.</description>

      <description>Everyone is used to taking their mobile with them, so that means location basedapps for mobiles will start to become more popular.

On a fun side, many of the new location based mobile apps have games or allow you to collect rewards for visiting new places.

      <description>Foursquareand Gowallahave been grabbing the headlines and few companies are starting to monitor and track these services. RJ Metrics claims Foursquare will hit 2 million usersthis week.Somewhere amongst the stats, you’ll see new users for Foursquare are growing around 14,000 per week but recently peaked at 20,000 new users. This is probably due to active promotions such as being featured in Apple or Android TV adverts. August &amp;amp; September are usually quieter months for data revenue and usage thanks to Summer (same for Jan &amp;amp; Feb Downunder), it will be interesting to track the user take up and usage to see if this is different.</description>

      <description>Foursquare is still the UK’s most popular location based check-in game to play on your mobile. I’ve said it before that Foursquare would come out on tops over Gowalla and Brightkite.
These maps (thanks to Checkin Mania) indicate the difference in the number of locations that users have submitted to each service. The growth from crowd sourced locations and points of interest reflects in the growth of that services usage (ie the most popular service gets the most contributions from users) The point of reference is London Borough Market – one of the more famous places in London to visit.</description>

      <description>Foursquare can be loads of fun for the casual user and collecting badges can be just as fun as trying to be the local town mayor. Foursquare has still to come up with a good tool for events, but it does have the Swarm badge.
Get 50 of your best friends to checkin at the same location at the same time … and you’ll get the Swarm badge too.

      <description>Starting your plan for social media marketing in a small or big business should be driven by a need or a reason.
Why use Social Media – because your customers are using it! First step in your social media marketing plan is to open powerpoint or write on a flipchart the reason why you need to use social media, some good reasons include:
 most of our target audience use social media (no brainer), or because visits to your brand or company website are down as our customers spend more time on social media sites (better) to deliver a sales &amp;amp; marketing programme using online &amp;amp; social media  There are probably plenty of other good reasons you can think of.</description>

      <description>Social Media marketing – using Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Google+ … needs to form part of any marketing plan across the marketing mix. Treating Social Media as a separate activity from the rest of your marketing is a No-No … In fact social media should be integrated into every campaign or promotion.
Social Media marketing fits into new customer acquisition, customer retention, CRM, customer loyalty and anything else that customers do and thats true for D2C brands as well as B2B marketers.</description>

The problem is that installation via Virtualbox will complete but the user will not be able to ‘register’ their copy Windows 7.
The only way to install Windows 7 Upgrade using Virtualbox is to first install Windows XP and then run the Windows 7 Upgrade disc.</description>

      <description>As far as book reviews go, from personal experience they are much harder to write then a review of a music album or live gig. So when reading VirtualBox 3.1 Beginners Guideby Alfonso V. Romero (Packt Publishing) I was surprised at how easy the book was to read and how an experienced VirtualBox user can dip in and find something new.
VirtualBox is one of my favourite system virtualisation apps that I use on my Mac and my Windows machines.</description>

      <description>Managing wifi on your Android mobile phonecan be a hassle, so at least there are now 3 good apps for you to use to make your wifi experience better.
##Wifinder
Is the most technical looking of the 3 apps – turning it on was a bit of shock when compared to the user experience of the other 2 apps. WiFinder only has 1 button aptly labelled New Scan. You then press and hold on the WiFi SSID to see the more familar Android Wifi Connect.</description>

      <description>Foursquare is now open to business and is moving beyond geo-tagging and location based social networking. But is Foursquare really open to business? After trying to claim my business location and setup an offer for visitors its now been 3 weeks without a reply.
In the UK right now, I believe there is an opportunity for Gowalla, Foursquare, etc to setup a small but viable business team to work with digital agencies or mobile marketing specialists here.</description>

      <description>I just added the Skimlinkswordpress plugin to my site. Skimlinks is my first step into affiliate marketing (is that what it is?). The wordpress plugin was very easy to install – but I think I should have read up more on affiliate marketing so it was over to the NMA magazine who recently ran an special on affiliate marketing to help me out.
In essence, affiliate marketing involves any 3rd party creating content that is linked to a product page and the affiliate gets a commission for the sale.</description>

      <description>ZOHO CRM has some great features including web to lead forms – but they don’t really look too stylish. Especially if you use 3rd party tools for your web forms.
If you use custom web to lead forms you may have to make the change to using the more secure HTTPS connection. After I noticed the web to lead form was not working I checked the standard code from ZOHO.</description>

On this website I’ve written a lot on Android phones and apps.Around 6000 apps have been removed from the Apple store recently due to their erotic nature. It’s not that Android Market has no quality control – Adult or Erotic does not exist as a content category in Android Market but dating apps or other soft-porn apps so far have not shown huge growth (ahem) on Android.</description>

      <description>Recent indepth report from New Media Age in the UK focused on the internet usage habits of kids.
Kids research is hard – the age group is from 7 – 13. They are already exposed to a lot of marketing, aware of trends and ‘peer pressure’, but still very much aware of having to please their parents all of the time. It’s also very difficult to ask questions about anything anti-social, illegal due to the young age and formative, questioning minds.</description>

      <description>Where to start with building a mobile app or going mobile has been a popular topic for some time. Many FMCG brands and agencies are requesting only quotes for mobile apps – forgetting the less popular java app or branded mobile game. At the expense of budget – haha – focusing on a mobile app can be a costly exercise starting from about 10k to 100k plus.
Marketing Agencies and their Brands need to go and reconsider their mobile strategy – and if you’ve already built a mobile app – you maybe disappointed how it looks on the larger screen devices.</description>

Gartners forecast goes on to mention that 82 per cent of downloads would be free apps … leaving 18 per cent of downloads to come up with cash.
4.5 billion downloads is quite staggering – even if Apple is set to announce its about to hit its 3 billionth download.</description>

      <description>South Africa is one of the fastest growing markets for mobile and internet usage is also growing rapidly. A history of poor international bandwidth / connectivity has meant speeds have remained slow.
South Africa’s internet users grew from 4.6 million to 5.3 million last year, a rise of 15%, according to research by World Wide Worx, a technology and research and strategy organisation, sponsored by Cisco.
The climb follows years of stagnation between 2002 to 2007, when internet penetration in South Africa never rose above 7%.</description>

      <description>So I have had to rebuild my Mac running OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard 3 times in the past 2 days after having problems with a t-mobile usb modem which corrupts the hard drive.Here’s the short list of my favourite, can’t live without em, just got to install them apps:
Best Apps for your Mac  ClamXav – still the best and most recommended free virus protection for your mac Adium – pronounced like stadium, this is the multi chat application for the mac Skype – for free calls to the office and home Dropbox – for sharing files between the office and clients Mac Office 2008 – word, powerpoint and to some extent excel, because all my templates are Office based and the guys in the office use PC’s.</description>

      <description>Sounds like good news in the UK market ‘opening’ up to more distribution channels for the iPhone. Tesco’s annouced it plans to start selling the iPhone by the end of the year and promised to add value to the market, where prices are stagnating between O2 and Orange.
What this means is that Tesco will be just another distributor like the Carphone Warehouse — and so at first, it didn’t seem clear if customers will have a choice of O2 or Orange.</description>

      <description>Should you be worried that you don’t have an iPhone app? Do you know if you’re website works on a mobile? what about mobile SEO? It is very important for CEO’s and CMO’s to add mobile to their communications and marketing strategy.
The fact that most companies have yet to build a mobile website shows you are not alone and many companies want to know what they should do first.</description>

      <description>Sony Ericsson delivered a blow to Microsoft on Tuesday when it unveiled its latest Xperia handset, which unlike its Windows-powered predecessors is based on Google’s Android operating system.
Called X10, the flagship smartphone comes with a new Sony Ericsson-designed user interface that aggregates the user’s contacts and communications from the likes of Facebook and Twitter into a single address book.
The system is akin to HTC’s Sense interface, and Motorola’s Motoblur interface, both of which feature on the respective companies’ new Android phones.</description>

      <description>Excellence in customer service is one thing that Turkey can be proud of. As a direct result of years of high unemployment businesses and individuals are finding ways to ‘add value’ and earn a few Lira. There are many positiv arguments for employing people in ‘low paid’ jobs that improve everyones living.
It’s been 2 years since I was living in Istanbul. I’ve returned for a week and was looking out for signs of the impact of the ‘credit crunch’.</description>

      <description>Recently the blogosphere has gone a bit crazy, excuse my lack of hyperbole about the Android platform. Was this ‘Android’ supposed to do battle with the iPhone?
Just because no operators or manufacturers have openly commented about their smart phone sales figures doesn’t mean its bad news. Looking at the number of Android powered phones out now or due in the next 2 months shows a lot of promise
 HTC Hero – some bloggers say it’s the best Android yet G1 – the funny one with the flip out keyboard, still only with T-Mobile Magic – Vodafone took this and the Android platform global Tattoo – coming out again to Vodafone before xmas Motorola DEXT – a lifesaver for Motorola – probably the phone that saves them.</description>

      <description>XNJB: is the app of the day for people who have used MP3 players from Creative technology. Moving to a Mac I was at a lose as to how to copy music to my Creative Zen and how to charge my Creative on my Mac.
This is where XNJB comes to the rescue and lets you copy music or charge your Creative while running Mac OSX 10.6 Snow Leopard.
XNJB should be bundled with Creative Media Players … after all these years and all the marketing hype around the Mac not having official support for Mac is sometimes a death knell or ‘dirge’ for any brand.</description>

      <description>Balsamiq – I love it – the fonts and stuff can seem a bit cheesy … but I’ve take to this like a duck to water. Its much more useful than powerpoint, visio or other tools as its designed for wireframing.
Being built on Adobe Air means anyone can use it.
It’s very quick to create a UE design and while I couldn’t find a template or mockup for cell phone / mobile phone.</description>

      <description>Following on yesterday’s news that Orange Uk will start selling iPhone … ending O2 / Telefonica’s virtual monopoly in the UK. Today, Vodafone in UK and Ireland announced their plans to sell Apple iPhones.
Good news for the operators? well ending the monopoly of iPhone was a good move. An operator with a data usage strategy will want to be selling iPhones along side other data hungry phones like RIM, Android, Symbian devices.</description>

      <description>Tip of the day: Windows Vista clean install doesn’t work on a partitioned drive AND if you then partition the drive after installing Vista, the SP2 will not install as well.
Effectively this means you should keep your primary drive as 1 partition … or wait til after you’ve installed Vista and all the service packs.
There is a short microsoft kb on this ….
Will this affect installing Windows 7 for the same reason … I think so.</description>

      <description>Apple’s iPhone will be available to Orange customers in the UK later this year, ending rival O2’s exclusive deal over the must-have handset, the mobile operator said.
The announcement by Orange ends months of speculation that it was trying to muscle in on O2’s deal with Apple, which gave it exclusive UK rights to the iPhone in 2007. The 3G and 3GS versions will be available to Orange UK customers “later this year”, but no further details of dates, handset costs or tariffs are available yet, the firm said.</description>

      <description>Now that you’ve ripped and digitised all of your CD library – what do you do with your CD’s? One idea is to create a catalogue and then you can box or put away (or recycle) your CD’s and DVD’s giving you much more space to fill with books, CD’s or other stuff.If you’re like me, I’ve been ripping all my CD’s for years and the CD and cases were just collecting dust in my room.</description>

      <description>Virtualbox 3.0.4 is a new update released earlier this month. After updating to this new version file sharing between mac os and the guest windows vista has stopped working.
Something wonderful has happened and there is a new feature that has been added … Under the Devices Menu there is a new entry for “Sharing Folders” – you can now create shared folders in realtime
However to make the shared folders work you still must use the old method of mapping a network drive and remember to type your shared folder name as</description>

      <description>Will Google Wave change SMS texting and instant messaging? Most likely … but that’s about the best answer right now. Google will have to find partners to help ‘aggregate’ chat and email and address Internet infrastructure issues in a number of countries.
Thanks to Googles reach, Wave can launch and get a good penetration into its addressable Gmail base. It’s all looking good with a Public Beta? of 100,000 invites due to be sent out in September.</description>

      <description>I’ve been using keyboard shortcuts for Microsoft Office on Windows for years. So here I am now using Mac Office on a Macbook Pro and still trying to figure out how to get around the keyboard.Tip of the Day – Windows Excel Alt+Enter and in Mac Office Excel keyboard shortcut is Fn+Ctrl+Alt
This adds a carriage return within the current cell and its great for doing long text entry in 1 cell.</description>

      <description>So its Happy Birthday to Apple and its App Store – 1 year old. Its created a new industry and probably will change the way everyone digests content – now that everything has an app or a widget you dont need to browse for it.
Except for Search – Apple and the Apps store has changed how mobile phone manufacturers think about content like Nokia, RIM and Sony Ericsson all launched (or launching) app stores in the past 3 months.</description>

      <guid>https://damien1.github.io/general/in-the-future-avoiding-trends-and-how-to-write-about-it-198/</guid>
      <description>when writing about or thinking about the future start by writing these words ‘in the future’ or maybe ‘Wouldn’t it be cool, if in the future’.
Remember back at school doing free writing or projects on people in space. Teachers would always get you to write about the future and using the phrase ‘in the future’ sets you directly to writing about that.
So thinking about the future is not about tomorrow, next month or next year.</description>

      <description>In a few years time, many of us will want to retire … what’s going to happen to us and our communities we live in if suddenly todays 20 and 30 somethings are 80? What music or digital entertainment will there be? Remembering also that as we start ‘age’ we will have to work later in life beyond today’s retirement age.If, the aging population is bigger than the younger generation – does that mean nightclubs, discos and places like Ibiza will become the place for the 70+ age group?</description>

      <description>So this follows an earlier post of mine about Virtualbox and running Windows XP on a Macbook Pro. Virtualbox is a great piece of software for running virtual operating systems on another machine (like runing Windows 7 on a Mac OSX).Today’s guide shows that you can be up n running with Windows 7 RC in about 15 minutes … thats got to be good ??
So Grab your Windows 7 RC1 ISO file from the Windows website, grab a copy of Virtualbox for Mac and get going.</description>

      <description>The HTC Magic came out recently, so far its a exclusive to Vodafone. As a phone it has all the features you could desire, but its music player needs an over hall – first problem is the volume, its just too quiet.In a crowded room, on the London Tube or just working out at a gym the volume from the HTC Magic’s is just a whisper of what it should be – or am I going deaf?</description>

How afraid are we all becoming?

Virtualbox is configurable from its GUI interface and also has a larger set of command line options, which are all covered in the userguide on the Virtualbox download site</description>

      <description>Virtualbox is a dream freeware solution for anyone – novice to geek – who wants to run different computers inside their computer … virtual so to speak. Today I’ve been tinkering with getting Virtualbox working on a Mac laptop running WinXP.
Virtualbox from Oracle Sunis a freeware, open source virtualisation application .. it comes in a number of flavours – I’ve previously used it to run WinXP guests inside WinXP hosts for testing and at work it was the only way to install things without having to go to the IT helpdesk.</description>

So Datz announced unlimited DRM Free music downloads (legally) this week … the service has an upfront fee of £99.99 – probably too steep for most people to consider – but maybe Sainsburys thinks it will be a last minute stocking stuffer.</description>

.
Really does the ad say much – No … Does it try to convince you to switch – No … but maybe its a brand ad and not a product ad
Lots of talk of quality, runs tight, last, endurance and other words in the ad – so maybe you’ll see them more in the ‘product ads’ when they come out?</description>

      <description>I’ve had a look at the Sony Ericsson new Walkman W902 with retro chunky buttons much like a those on a casette walkman.
The phone’s not retro though – Clear Crystal Audio for your listening pleasure and a 5.0 mega pixel camera is a great feature. I think its also got a really good speaker to annoy Grannies on the bus with.
I hope it comes out with more than a 1Gb of memory!</description>

      <description>Damien says, one of the biggest problems with Linux has always been a lack of strength in its media players. Amarok v2 is now in the pipe and its looking great.
The Amarok 1 client which most Linux users had to use (it was the best option) really lacked in its options for managing artists, albums, compilations as it relied on a database driven columns view. I never found that easy to use.</description>

British Music Rights research shows that file-sharing is done by a large number of people and even more are downloading music.
Music week reports these findings:
42% of those surveyed say they have uploaded files.</description>

      <description>Apple has changed its tactics – a few weeks ago it launched Safari as a part of an update for iTunes users. Safari will now be changed from an update to new software not installed.
Many people rightly pointed out that this was a shady tactic to get software on peoples computers.

      <description>Comment: Internet traffic to the iPlayer site is growing rapidly supported by outside advertising posterboards as well as reminders during TV advertising. However a lot of internet traffic seems to be sucked up by their kservices P2P network which aims to share the downloaded files with other iPlayer users.
 UK Internet traffic to the BBC’s iPlayer website increased 14-fold between the week ending 8 December 2007 and the week ending 5 January.</description>

      <description> comment: The reason that Apple charges different retail prices in each market is due to the differences in wholesale prices charged in each market by the major labels. Apple could use this as leverage against the labels to lower their prices in all major EU markets

      <description>Comment: Pandora has been around for some time and grown in reputation as a free music discovery service. This is becoming a niche space because of the impact of internet radio or streaming licencing costs.
 In an email to users, Pandora founder Tim Westergren wrote:
“After over a year of trying, this has proved impossible. Both the PPL (which represents the record labels) and the MCPS/PRS Alliance (which represents music publishers) have demanded per track performance minima rates which are far too high to allow ad supported radio to operate and so, hugely disappointing and depressing to us as it is, we have to block the last territory outside of the US.</description>

      <description>The British Phonographic Industry, which represents the British recorded-music business, said total music download sales for the year topped 77 million, a 50 percent increase over 2006.
2.94m online music tracks were downloaded in the UK in the last week of 2007, according to the BPI, a record industry body. The figure is double that for the same time in 2006, when 1.47m tracks were downloaded, and nearly three times that for the same week in 2005, when only 1m songs were downloaded.</description>

A few interesting stories that I will certainly be watching
 Warner and Amazon announced DRM Free for their USA store – I wonder how long before Amazon launches in the UK Fox announces video content on Itunes – but its still DRM’d Billboard says 2008 will be the year we get digital album artwork as part of our online purchases – great news!</description>

      <description>O2 sent an email to stores an hour after the launch, claiming that 2,000 customers who bought iPhones from O2 stores had registered their devices at 7:02pm. That figure soared to 8,000 by the end of the night.
Sales vary considerably from store to store, with anecdotes of disinterest from some, disbelief at the price tag from others and customers queuing in the snow at O2’s Aberdeen store.

      <description>Microsoft is closing its acquisition of Musiwave, the French mobile music company, for USD46m in cash and USD4m in debt. The price is less than half what Musiwave’s California-based owner Openwave paid when it bought the firm for USD117m in Jan 2006.
The deal is important for Microsoft as it gives it a foot in the door for mobile content delivery to consumers … as well Musiwave still works with a lot of the leading mobile operators.</description>

Facebook opened up its network for 3rd parties to develop their own applications earlier this year and this has resulted in a mass of new developments for everything from ‘super-poke’ to free sms.</description>

But now Gizmodo, have suggested that an announcement is due today and that both operators will win, leveraging the successes of both networks in different countries.
This would be great news for GSM users globally, a non-exclusive agreement would have far reaching appeal to mobile phone users than the American AT&amp;amp;T arrangement.</description>

The new site is a reminder of early telco portals from the dotcom error and features include news, reviews, video, with a mix of traditional telco products and services.</description>

Competition among the companies in the telecommunications sector is becoming brutal and the announcement gave the competition a whole new dimension.
Meanwhile, Avea’s general Manager Cüneyt Türktan accused Turkcell of being inconsistent for heading to the court for the annulment of the number portability, after supporting it first.</description>

Yıldırım said he was expecting interest from the existing three GSM operators in Turkey — Turkcell, Vodafone (formerly Telsim) and Avea — in the investigation of feasible price studies for 3G licenses.</description>

Mohamed Sidek also asked department heads to designate areas where official matters are discussed as “information security zones,” the paper added.</description>

      <description>Turkey’s officials announced at the start of 2007 the introduction of mobile number portability (MNP) for its 3 mobile operators, Vodafone, Turkcell and Avea. MNP allows customers to change carriers and keep their number, referred to as porting.
There is an element of prestige in Turkey about what your prefix number is, so allowing people to port will open up competition more, however Turkey’s largest mobile operator, Turkcell, has now filed a lawsuit calling for the cancellation of MNP.</description>

With a selection of mobile phones from Christmas 2006 sitting on my desk from several big names its apparent that 3rd parties are now working with the terminal suppliers directly to port their web experience to phone apps. You can see this happening in Europe primarily with Google for blogging and search, but in the US, Helio has had success with its brand phone and social-networking tools.</description>

Some of us still remember the early days when 3G business cases were built on the success of LBS’s – everyone was going to make a killing. By far the best ‘LBS’ service on any portal are:
 live train timetables (is my train on time) traffic cameras (where is that jam) mobile operator concierge service (for those unusal location requests)  So does throwing a GPS chip in a phone help you?</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Australian communications minister Helen Coonan plans to introduce to parliament legislation to extend the current safeguards that apply to content delivered over the internet or television to content delivered over convergent devices such as mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will include prohibition of content rated X18+ and above, as well as requirements for consumer advice and age-restrictions on access to content suited only to adults. This has impact across the board as for most people the internet is seen to be ‘open’ and attempts to block porn are like trying to plug holes in a leaking dam. Operators have also argued they should be treated like ISP’s and can’t be held responsible for what customers do with their phones&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems only yesterday that operators were switching off their analogue mobile networks, yet now its the turn of the retailer to make to turn off the switch. Online retail brand Dixon’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brandrepublic.com/bulletins/digital/article/581379/end-era-dixons-drops-analogue-radios/&#34;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; they will stop selling analogue radios and that the death is imminent also for portable stereos and CD players. I guess the portable tapeplayer and VHS are already ‘dead’ by their reckoning. For mobile operators, the problem is confounded by the need to actually support all this old tech stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SMS pricing initiatives</title>

      <guid>https://damien1.github.io/general/sms-pricing-initiatives-34/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary: Operators are competing with large bundles of ‘free’ text messages. This pricing prevents text over IP or other apps taking off, but there is still a long way to go to grow data usage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still alot of work to be done to grow data usage across the business and consumer base. One of the challenges is working out pricing. In Ireland, they are trialling €49 per month unlimited plan. In T-mobile UK they have a £7.50 unlimited data plan but services like Skype are barred.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>In the news today, seven of the big name operators are forming an industry organisation to create a common 4G mobile phone network standard. The group is tentatively called Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN).
The networks include KPN Mobile, T-Mobile, Orange, Sprint Nextel, Vodafone, China Mobile and NTT Docomo. They plan to establish a non-profit company in the US by the end of July. I’m not sure why they picked the US – are they getting a tax free status if they can sort out the existing networks?</description>

      <description>summary: customer care can only go so far, when the customer’s relationship starts to fail with an operator, people will look for new solutions.
I’ve just moved flat and am stuck between two operators. The old place had BT and the existing place is still with Bulldog – with the old tenants vanished overseas, no one will disconnect the line. Thanks to local loop unbundling, I can’t even get a POTS lines connected.</description>

      <description>Summary: We still have a long way to go to accept adverts on your mobile. While Europeans have said yes to Mobile TV and no to paid for advertising, the US is talking up one-second adverts called &amp;lsquo;Blinks&amp;rsquo;.
Clear Communications is talking to media buyers and agenices about blinks – one-second adverts that allow just enought time to recognise the brand by its gingle. You can imagine that two syllable Danone or perhaps the McDonalds &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Loving it&amp;rsquo; … or maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll hear someone shout out &amp;lsquo;Drink Pepsi&amp;rsquo; in a sudden and startling manner.</description>

      <description>An article on http://3g.co.uk reports that the number of HSDPA networks (known as 3G Broadband) has now topped 100. That&amp;rsquo;s either commercially available or in deployment. This new survey confirms that 30 HSDPA networks have commercially launched services in 23 countries/territories, delivering the full broadband experience to subscribers. We expect the number of commercial HSDPA networks will more than double to 63 by end 2006. All WCDMA networks are expected to activate the HSDPA upgrade.</description>

      <description>So the BBC have released their Creative Futures report yesterday looking at the future of the Beeb. While it will take some time to digest and come to comprehend what this means to our viewing and reading habits, take a minute to think about how this impacts our industry??
 All content made &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;FREELY&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; available on a website starting today going back to 1937  and other recommendations include:
• Relaunching the BBC&amp;rsquo;s website to include more personalisation, richer audio-visual and user generated content</description>

      <description>Opinion: There are many online services that customers will turn to for support when your customer service goes bad – be on top of what is going on. It may even save you money.
More than 40 percent of online chat about UK mobile operators is related to customer service issues. Not only is customer care the most common topic of discussion, it also attracts the most negative sentiment, with only one UK operator, Orange, scoring positively, reports WaveMetrix.</description>

      <description>It’s like trying to sell ice creams to eskimos – do you go for depth and variety of your content catalogue or stick to the sickly seasonal or monthly favourites … you can be damned either way.
What I’m thinking is that most mobile content sales via WAP were dominated by the operator portals, but you invariably find that top downloads page will have the Star Wars March, Axel F and something from Guns n Roses (AC/DC).</description>

      <description>Think about this carefully – any RSS stream sent free to your mobile by SMS … you’ve got your blackberry, you’ve got your live news alerts and weekly MMS updates – but who tells you about that other stuff you’re really really interested in? Talk about giving away the baby and the bath water – but maybe this is just a crazy idea with some sense behind it.
As part of an update to its alerts feature, Yahoo added a feature that allows users to get RSS results via SMS.</description>

      <description>MocoNews.net: mobile content news: &amp;ldquo;Mobile Blogging generates an immediate reduction of up to 70% in the propensity of a user to churn.&amp;rdquo;
Results of a 12-month survey of two million subscribers on four operators which were using NewBay&amp;rsquo;s Software FoneBlog mobile blogging and multimedia album solution have been released.
According to NewBay the result comes from increased loyalty – based on personal content on the moblog. What is obvious here is if you have personal content and you can&amp;rsquo;t move/download it simply, then there is a barrier to change.</description>

      <description>interesting global research on mobile phones from a US university.
57% of all users say they&amp;rsquo;re willing to spend no more than $5 per month on mobile data services — including text messages, and the most important factor in choosing a mobile service is cheap voice calls. That&amp;rsquo;s backed up by another piece of research this week that says it&amp;rsquo;s cheap voice plans, not fast data driving 3G.
More than a third of users worldwide have cameraphones, up from 21% last year, and 59% have color screens, up from 44%.</description>

Yes – I’m back at Vodafone looking after companies launching live for the first time. Luckily that means I get to travel to these places too … thanks to work!</description>

Q: Does it ever get windy in Australia? I have never seen it rain on TV, how do the plants grow? (UK).
A: We import all plants fully grown and then just sit around watching

      <description>Indecision is the key to flexibility. You can’t tell which way the train went by looking at the track. There is absolutely no substitute for a genuine lack of preparation. Happiness is merely the remission of pain. Nostalgia isn’t what it used to be. Sometimes too much drink is not enough. The facts, although interesting, are irrelevant. The careful application of terror is also a form of communication. Someone who thinks logically is a nice contrast to the real world.</description>

      <description>so it was back to getting up early! well 630am! before a short ride to the port of Kusadasi and then goodbye to Turkey. The authorities are not organised and a tour operator (official) collects your passports and arranges the ferry boarding passes. Next time dont arrive early for the ferry or you get your passport back LAST!.
Saying goodbye to Neil in Samos I decided to go to Paros and maybe then on to Athens.</description>

      <description>All Turkish men shave there armpits .. weird .. dont ask me why!!
The land looks really hard and barren but they produce so much … limes, apricots, melons, sunflower seeds/oil
I’d go back to Istanbul in a sec … something about it appeals // perhaps its the age? or perhaps its just the bustling city?
Turkey is trying damn hard to move up in the world – and join the EU … so will watch it and maybe come back!</description>

Istanbul is real! I&amp;rsquo;m actually here! I am still just as moved now as i was 2 weeks ago when I left Aus. Weird, maybe this feeling will never go.
I sit on the roof of the hostel and can look over the water to Asia! I look to my left and see the Blue Mosque, on the right the Sancta Sophia, further over is the Topkapi Palace.</description>
